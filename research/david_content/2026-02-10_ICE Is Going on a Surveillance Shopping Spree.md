## Summary

[TRENDING] ICE is dramatically expanding its surveillance budget to $28.7 billion in 2025, positioning itself as a massive domestic monitoring apparatus with capabilities to track, target, and potentially control immigrant populations and beyond. The agency's massive funding allows for unprecedented technological surveillance infrastructure that extends far beyond its stated immigration enforcement mission.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has a new budget under the current administration, and they are going on a surveillance tech shopping spree. Standing at $28.7 billion dollars for the year 2025 (nearly triple their 2024 budget) and at least another $56.25 billion over the next three years, ICE's budget would be the envy of many national militaries around the world. Indeed, this budget would put ICE as the 14th most well-funded military in the world, right between Ukraine and Israel. There are many different agencies under U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that deal with immigration, as well as non-immigration related agencies such as Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ICE is specifically the enforcement arm of the U.S. immigration apparatus. Their stated mission is to “[p]rotect America through criminal investigations and enforcing immigration laws to preserve national security and public safety.” Of course, ICE doesn’t just end up targeting, surveilling, harassing, assaulting, detaining, and torturing people who are undocumented immigrants. They have targeted people on work permits, asylum seekers, permanent residents (people holding “green cards”), naturalized citizens, and even citizens by birth. While the NSA and FBI might be the first agencies that come to mind when thinking about surveillance in the U.S., ICE should not be discounted. ICE has always engaged in surveillance and intelligence-gathering as part of their mission. A 2022 report by Georgetown Law’s Center for Privacy and Technology found the following: ICE had scanned the driver’s license photos of 1 in 3 adults. ICE had access to the driver’s license data of 3 in 4 adults. ICE was tracking the movements of drivers in cities home to 3 in 4 adults. 

## Analysis

This reveals a massive expansion of state surveillance capabilities targeting vulnerable populations, with potential for widespread tracking, data collection, and systemic control mechanisms. The scale of funding suggests not just immigration enforcement, but the development of a comprehensive surveillance system that could be weaponized against broader populations.
