## Summary

Europe is using the TikTok controversy as a trojan horse to implement comprehensive digital identity verification systems, which will create mandatory age and identity tracking infrastructure across digital platforms. This approach transforms content moderation into a mechanism for universal digital surveillance.

## Analysis

Digital ID requirements masquerading as child protection represent a critical expansion of surveillance infrastructure.
