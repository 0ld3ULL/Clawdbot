## Summary

ICE is adopting military-style tactics for immigration enforcement, effectively militarizing domestic surveillance and control of population movement. The article suggests ICE is operating with quasi-military authority but without the disciplined protocols of actual military operations, potentially increasing risks of excessive force and civil rights violations.

## Content

WIRED asked an active military officer to break down immigration enforcement actions in Minneapolis and elsewhere.

## Analysis

ICE represents a critical infrastructure of state control, using paramilitary tactics to monitor, track, and potentially suppress populations. The militarization of immigration enforcement creates a dangerous precedent for broad surveillance and potential suppression of dissent, expanding the government's capacity to 'switch off' targeted individuals through legal and physical force.
