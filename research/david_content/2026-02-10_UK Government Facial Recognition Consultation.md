## Analysis

Facial recognition represents a critical control technology that enables instant identification, tracking, and potential 'switching off' of individuals by mapping biometric data to financial/social profiles. The consultation suggests government intent to embed this technology systemically, creating a digital panopticon with unprecedented personal tracking capabilities.
