## Summary

US immigration agencies are using a face recognition app that fundamentally fails at identity verification, yet continues to be deployed against both immigrants and citizens. This reveals a surveillance system more interested in tracking populations than actual accurate identification.

## Content

ICE has used Mobile Fortify to identify immigrants and citizens alike over 100,000 times, by one estimate. It wasn't built to work like that—and only got approved after DHS abandoned its own privacy rules.

## Analysis

This exposes critical infrastructure of mass surveillance targeting populations through unreliable technological means. The app represents a dangerous precedent of technological control that bypasses traditional privacy protections, operating with abandoned privacy rules and massive deployment despite known technical failures.
