## Summary

The EU is attempting to restrict Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which are crucial tools for online privacy, as part of expanding digital age verification systems. This represents a systematic approach to reducing online anonymity and increasing state surveillance capabilities.

European policymakers are treating VPN adoption as behavior to be contained. The post EU Targets VPNs as Age Checks Expand appeared first on Reclaim The Net.

## Analysis

VPN restrictions directly undermine digital privacy and anonymity, creating infrastructure that can track and potentially control individual internet access. By targeting VPNs, authorities are eliminating citizens' ability to bypass surveillance and circumvent restrictive digital policies, effectively creating a more controlled online environment.
