## Summary

Age verification laws have rapidly expanded across the United States, creating mandatory digital identification infrastructure that tracks and controls internet access under the guise of 'safety'. These laws create comprehensive digital surveillance mechanisms that can effectively limit or completely block individual internet access.

2025 was the year age verification went from a fringe policy experiment to a sweeping reality across the United States. Half of the U.S. now mandates age verification for accessing adult content or social media platforms. Nine states saw their laws take effect this year alone, with more coming in 2026. The good news is that courts have blocked many of the laws seeking to impose age-verification gates on social media, largely for the same reasons that EFF opposes these efforts. Age-verification measures censor the internet and burden access to online speech. Though age-verification mandates are often touted as "online safety" measures for young people, the laws actually do more harm than good. They undermine the fundamental speech rights of adults and young people alike, create new barriers to internet access, and put at risk all internet users' privacy, anonymity, and security. If you're feeling overwhelmed by this onslaught of laws and the invasive technologies behind them, you're not alone. That's why we've launched EFF's Age Verification Resource Hub at EFF.org/Age—a one-stop shop to understand what these laws actually do, what's at stake, why EFF opposes all forms of age verification, how to protect yourself, and how to join the fight for a free, open, private, and safe internet. Moreover, there is hope. Although the Supreme Court ruled that imposing age-verification gates to access adult content does not violate the First Amendment on its face, the legal fight continues regarding whether those laws are constitutional. As we built the hub throughout 2025, we also fought state mandates in legislatures, courts, and regulatory hearings. Here's a summary of what happened this year. The Laws That Took Effect (And Immediately Backfired) Nine states’ age verification laws for accessing adult content went into effect in 2025: South Carolina (January 1) Florida (January 1) Tennessee (January 13) Georgia (July 1) Wyoming (July 1) North Dakota (August 1) Arizona (September

## Analysis

This represents a massive expansion of digital ID infrastructure, enabling precise tracking and potential 'switching off' of individual internet access. The laws create a systemic method of digital control disguised as child protection, with broad implications for privacy, anonymity, and fundamental speech rights. Digital age verification is essentially a Trojan horse for comprehensive surveillance and potential citizen control mechanisms.
