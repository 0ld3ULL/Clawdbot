## Summary

AI and satellite technology are being proposed as a new mechanism for monitoring nuclear arms treaties, potentially creating an unprecedented global surveillance infrastructure that could track and analyze military movements with machine precision.

## Content

The last major nuclear arms treaty between the US and Russia just expired. Some experts believe a combination of satellite surveillance, AI, and human reviewers can take its place. Others, not so much.

## Analysis

This reveals a critical expansion of AI-powered surveillance technology into geopolitical monitoring, creating a transnational system that can continuously track and assess military assets with algorithmic precision. The infrastructure represents a significant leap in automated global observation capabilities, where machines can interpret and report on strategic movements without human limitations.
