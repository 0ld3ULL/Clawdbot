## Summary

Iran is finalizing a comprehensive digital surveillance system that allows near-total monitoring and control of citizen internet access and digital communications. The regime has systematically built infrastructure to shut down internet access and track individual online behaviors.

## Content

After more than 15 years of draconian measures, culminating in an ongoing internet shutdown, the Iranian regime seems to be staggering toward its digital surveillance endgame.

## Analysis

Demonstrates a near-total digital control mechanism where the state can instantly silence, track, and potentially neutralize digital dissent through total internet infrastructure control. This represents an extreme model of technological oppression that could become a blueprint for other authoritarian governments.
