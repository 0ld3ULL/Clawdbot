## Summary

The Federal Reserve is preparing to implement 'skinny master accounts', which could represent a new mechanism for more granular financial monitoring and potential control of banking infrastructure. This appears to be a step towards greater centralized oversight of financial transactions, potentially creating more intrusive tracking capabilities.

## Content

Fed. Governor Christopher Waller said the central bank plans to roll out its "skinny master account" proposal before the end of the year.

## Analysis

This reveals potential infrastructure for financial surveillance by creating new Federal Reserve account mechanisms that could enable more precise tracking and potential interference with individual financial activities. The 'skinny' designation suggests granular control capabilities that align with David Flip's core concern about switchable financial infrastructure.
