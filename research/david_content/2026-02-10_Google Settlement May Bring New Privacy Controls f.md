## Summary

Google's real-time bidding system exposes personal data to thousands of companies in milliseconds, creating a massive surveillance infrastructure that tracks individuals across digital spaces through detailed personal information broadcasts.

EFF has long warned about the dangers of the “real-time bidding” (RTB) system powering nearly every ad you see online. A proposed class-action settlement with Google over their RTB system is a step in the right direction towards giving people more control over their data. Truly curbing the harms of RTB, however, will require stronger legislative protections. What Is Real-Time Bidding? RTB is the process by which most websites and apps auction off their ad space. Unfortunately, the milliseconds-long auctions that determine which ads you see also expose your personal information to thousands of companies a day. At a high-level, here’s how RTB works: The moment you visit a website or app with ad space, it asks an ad tech company to determine which ads to display for you. This involves sending information about you and the content you’re viewing to the ad tech company. This ad tech company packages all the information they can gather about you into a “bid request” and broadcasts it to thousands of potential advertisers. The bid request may contain information like your unique advertising ID, your GPS coordinates, IP address, device details, inferred interests, demographic information, and the app or website you’re visiting. The information in bid requests is called “bidstream data” and typically includes identifiers that can be linked to real people. Advertisers use the personal information in each bid request, along with data profiles they’ve built about you over time, to decide whether to bid on the ad space. The highest bidder gets to display an ad for you, but advertisers (and the adtech companies they use to buy ads) can collect your bidstream data regardless of whether or not they bid on the ad space. Why Is Real-Time Bidding Harmful? A key vulnerability of real-time bidding is that while only one advertiser wins the auction, all participants receive data about the person who would see their ad. As a result, anyone posing as an ad buyer can access a stream of sens

## Analysis

RTB represents a near-perfect digital tracking mechanism that creates granular individual profiles through constant data exposure. Every website visit becomes a potential surveillance event where personal data is auctioned and analyzed, enabling unprecedented monitoring of individual behavior without meaningful consent.
