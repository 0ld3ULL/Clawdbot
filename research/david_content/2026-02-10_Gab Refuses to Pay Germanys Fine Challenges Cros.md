## Summary

Germany attempts to impose cross-border digital censorship by fining Gab, an alternative social media platform, for content deemed unacceptable under German law. This represents an extraterritorial effort to control online speech and digital platforms beyond national boundaries.

## Content

Berlin treats the internet as annexed territory, asserting control wherever Germans can read a post. The post Gab Refuses to Pay Germany’s Fine, Challenges Cross-Border Online Censorship appeared first on Reclaim The Net.

## Analysis
