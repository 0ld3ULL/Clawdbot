## Analysis

This appears to be a direct challenge to expanding surveillance infrastructure by a privacy watchdog group. David Flip would be deeply interested in documenting how civil society organizations are mapping and resisting emerging control mechanisms that threaten individual autonomy. The consultation response potentially reveals specific legal/technical pathways being proposed for increased state monitoring.
