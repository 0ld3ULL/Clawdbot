## Summary

The FDIC has been pressured to reveal its 'pause letters' that allegedly coordinated a de-banking effort against crypto companies, suggesting a coordinated government attempt to restrict financial access for specific industries.

## Content

The banking regulator will revise transparency policies to settle Coinbase's "Operation Choke Point 2.0" lawsuit.

## Analysis

This reveals a potential systemic mechanism for financial exclusion, where government regulators can strategically 'pause' or restrict banking services to companies or sectors they politically disfavor. The FDIC's initial resistance to transparency and Coinbase's lawsuit exposes an infrastructure of financial control that can effectively 'switch off' economic participation without due process.
