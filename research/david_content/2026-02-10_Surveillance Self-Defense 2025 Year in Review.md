## Summary

Electronic Frontier Foundation provides updated guides for protecting against digital surveillance, indicating an ongoing arms race between privacy advocates and surveillance infrastructure. The guides cover encryption, phone privacy, and protest safety, revealing the expanding sophistication of surveillance self-defense tactics.

## Content

Our Surveillance Self-Defense (SSD) guides, which provide practical advice and explainers for how to deal with government and corporate surveillance, had a big year. We published several large updates to existing guides and released three all new guides. And with frequent massive protests across the U.S., our guide to attending a protest remained one of the most popular guides of the year, so we made sure our translations were up to date. (Re)learn All You Need to Know About Encryption We started this year by taking a deep look at our various encryption guides, which start with the basics before moving up to deeper concepts. We slimmed each guide down and tried to focus on making them as clear and concise as deep explainers on complicated topics can be. We reviewed and edited four guides in total: What Should I Know About Encryption? Key Concepts in Encryption Key Verification A Deep Dive on End-to-End Encryption: How Do Public Key Encryption Systems Work? And if you’re not sure where to start, we got you covered with the new Interested in Encryption? playlist. New Guides We launched three new guides this year, including iPhone and Android privacy guides, which walk you through all the various privacy options of your phone. Both of these guides received a handful of updates throughout their first year as new features were released or, in the case of the iPhone, a new design language was introduced. These also got a fun little boost from a segment on "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver" telling people how to disable their phone’s advertising identifier. We also launched our How to: Manage Your Digital Footprint guide. This guide is designed to help you claw back some of the data you may find about yourself online, walking through different privacy options across different platforms, digging up old accounts, removing yourself from people search sites, and much more. Always Be Updating As is the case with most software, there is always incremental work to do. This year
