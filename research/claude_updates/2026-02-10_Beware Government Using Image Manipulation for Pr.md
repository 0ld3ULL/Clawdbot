## Summary

[TRENDING] Government manipulation of images using AI demonstrates potential risks and capabilities of image generation technologies, highlighting the importance of robust AI verification and ethical guidelines for our AI-driven projects.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem last week posted a photo of the arrest of Nekima Levy Armstrong, one of three activists who had entered a St. Paul, Minn. church to confront a pastor who also serves as acting field director of the St Paul Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office. A short while later, the White House posted the same photo – except that version had been digitally altered to darken Armstrong’s skin and rearrange her facial features to make it appear she was sobbing or distraught. The Guardian one of many media outlets to report on this image manipulation, created a handy slider graphic to help viewers see clearly how the photo had been changed. This isn’t about “owning the libs” — this is the highest office in the nation using technology to lie to the entire world. The New York Times reported it had run the two images through Resemble.AI, an A.I. detection system, which concluded Noem’s image was real but the White House’s version showed signs of manipulation. "The Times was able to create images nearly identical to the White House’s version by asking Gemini and Grok — generative A.I. tools from Google and Elon Musk’s xAI start-up — to alter Ms. Noem’s original image." Most of us can agree that the government shouldn’t lie to its constituents. We can also agree that good government does not involve emphasizing cruelty or furthering racial biases. But this abuse of technology violates both those norms. “Accuracy and truthfulness are core to the credibility of visual reporting,” the National Press Photographers Association said in a statement issued about this incident. “The integrity of photographic images is essential to public trust and to the historical record. Altering editorial content for any purpose that misrepresents subjects or events undermines that trust and is incompatible with professional practice.” This isn’t about “owning the libs” — this is the highest office in the nation using technology to lie to the entire world.

## Analysis

This reveals critical considerations for AI systems like The David Project and DEVA around image authenticity, potential bias detection, and the need for transparent AI behavior. The technical demonstration of image manipulation by AI models provides insights into potential safeguards we should implement.
