### Bug Fixes

* **structured outputs:** send structured output beta header when format is omitted ([#1158](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/issues/1158)) ([258494e](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/commit/258494e2b814a6a096b01e50f83560b4cf4a98ad))


### Chores

* remove claude-code-review workflow ([#1338](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/issues/1338)) ([aec4512](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-sdk-python/commit/aec4512305e8dce41df8ef0ab225f4939e099bcf))

## Analysis

Directly relevant for The David Project's Claude API integration, potentially improving how structured outputs are handled. The bug fix could help with more precise data extraction and formatting in AI agent systems like DEVA and David Flip.
