## Summary

[TRENDING] Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.6 demonstrates significant improvement in UI generation capabilities, requiring fewer iterations and providing more precise, contextually aligned outputs. The new model seems to better understand design constraints and can generate complex interfaces with minimal guidance.

I've been testing Opus 4.6 UI output since it was released, and it's miles ahead of 4.5.  With 4.5 the UI output was mostly meh, and I wasted a lot of tokens on iteration after iteration to get a semi-decent output.

I previously [shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1q4l76k/i_condensed_8_years_of_product_design_experience/) how I built a custom interface design [skill](https://github.com/Dammyjay93/interface-design) to fix the terrible default output. Pairing this with 4.6, I'm now one-shotting complex UI by simply attaching reference inspiration and providing minimal guidance. It's incredible how "crafted" the results feel; 4.6 adheres to the skill's design constraints way better than the previous model, although I find it's slower than 4.5, but I guess it's more thorough in its thinking.   
  
Kudos to the Anthropic team; this is a really solid model. If you are working on tooling or SaaS apps, this workflow indeed changes the game.

## Analysis

Directly applicable for The David Project's AI architecture, could enhance DEVA's interface generation, and provides insights into more efficient AI-driven design workflows. The ability to one-shot complex UIs with better constraint adherence is a major breakthrough for our agentic systems.
