## Summary

A Unity developer created a snow deformation technique using circle generation and camera-based image recording, which could enhance terrain interaction in Amphitheatre's game environments. The procedural terrain modification method demonstrates an innovative approach to dynamic surface rendering.

## Content

My new little tool to generate compressible snow.

The character squishes the snow beneath them, and the snowfall restores it. Sand and grass can also be used instead of snow, although this wasn’t intended and looks much worse.

I accomplished this by creating circles under the character, which the camera reads and records into an image that the snow is drawn from.

## Analysis

This technique could improve terrain interaction and visual feedback in Amphitheatre's multiplayer environment, potentially adding dynamic surface deformation for more immersive gameplay experiences. The camera-based image recording method might be adaptable to other terrain or physics-based interactions.
