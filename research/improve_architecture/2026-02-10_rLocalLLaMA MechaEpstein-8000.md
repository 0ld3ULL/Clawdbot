## Summary

[TRENDING] A developer trained a local LLM on a specific dataset using Qwen3-8B, demonstrating advanced techniques for dataset manipulation and local model training on limited hardware. The process highlights methods for custom AI model development and ethical considerations around dataset generation.

## Content

I know it has already been done but this is my AI trained on Epstein Emails. Surprisingly hard to do, as most LLMs will refuse to generate the dataset for Epstein, lol. Everything about this is local, the dataset generation, training, etc. Done in a 16GB RTX-5000 ADA.  
  
Anyway, it's based on Qwen3-8B and its quite funny. GGUF available at link.  
Also I have it online here if you dare: [https://www.neuroengine.ai/Neuroengine-MechaEpstein](https://www.neuroengine.ai/Neuroengine-MechaEpstein)

## Analysis

Directly relevant to The David Project's architectural approaches - shows techniques for custom model training, dataset handling, and overcoming content generation restrictions. Provides insights into local model development that could inform our AI agent system's flexibility and training methodologies.
