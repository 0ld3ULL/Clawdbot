## Summary

[TRENDING] User discusses the breakthrough of Qwen3-Coder-Next as a locally-runnable LLM that provides consistent, high-quality outputs comparable to cloud models, suggesting significant improvements in local AI inference capabilities.

Like many of you, I like to use LLM as tools to help improve my daily life, from editing my emails, to online search.

However, I like to use them as an "inner voice" to discuss general thoughts and get constructive critic. For instance, when I face life-related problems take might take me hours or days to figure out, a short session with an LLM can significantly quicken that process.

Since the original Llama was leaked, I've been using LLMs locally, but they I always felt they were lacking behind OpenAI or Google models. Thus, I would always go back to using ChatGPT or Gemini when I need serious output. If I needed a long chatting session or help with long documents, I didn't have choice to use the SOTA models, and that means willingly leaking personal or work-related data.

For me, Gemini-3 is the best model I've ever tried. I don't know about you, but I struggle sometimes to follow chatGPT's logic, but I find it easy to follow Gemini's. It's like that best friend who just gets you and speaks in your language.

Well, that was the case until I tried Qwen3-Coder-Next. For the first time, I could have stimulating and enlightening conversations with a local model. Previously, I used not-so-seriously Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking as local daily driver, but that model always felt a bit inconsistent; sometimes, I get good output, and sometimes I get dumb one.

However, Qwen3-Coder-Next is more consistent, and you can feel that it's a pragmatic model trained to be a problem-solver rather than being a sycophant. Unprompted, it will suggest an author, a book, or a theory that already exists that might help. I genuinely feel I am conversing with a fellow thinker rather than a echo chamber constantly paraphrasing my prompts in a more polish way. It's the closest model to Gemini-2.5/3 that I can run locally in terms of quality of experience.

**For non-coders, my point is do not sleep on Qwen3-Coder-Next simply because it's has the "coder" tag attached.**

I can't wait for for 

## Analysis

The model's consistency and problem-solving capabilities could inform The David Project's autonomous agent architecture, potentially offering insights into more reliable local inference for DEVA's voice assistant and David Flip's conversational intelligence. The local inference improvements are particularly relevant for reducing cloud dependency and improving response quality.
