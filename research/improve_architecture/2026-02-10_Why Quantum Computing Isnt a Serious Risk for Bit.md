## Summary

Current quantum computing lacks the capability to break Bitcoin's cryptographic protections, suggesting current AI and blockchain security models remain robust. The research indicates significant time before quantum computing poses a genuine threat to existing encryption systems.

## Content

New research says today’s quantum computers are far too weak to threaten Bitcoin’s cryptography, leaving the network years to prepare.

## Analysis

For The David Project and DEVA, this reinforces current cryptographic approaches and provides context for long-term AI system security planning. It indicates we have time to develop quantum-resistant architectures proactively.
