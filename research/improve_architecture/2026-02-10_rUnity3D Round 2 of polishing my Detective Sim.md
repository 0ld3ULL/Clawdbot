## Content

Thank you all so much for the feedback on my recent post. This is a update of the improved version of my scanning mechanic for "Welcome to Lightford" with the feedback. Its not fully there i still want to solve the clipping of the cables into the ground but what do you think now? I also added a laser pointer aiming visual so you actually see what area you scan before you shoot the sensors. UI also needs some more improvements i think

## Analysis

Directly applicable to Amphitheatre's gameplay mechanics, showing techniques for user interaction design, scanning/targeting systems, and iterative game development. Could inform DEVA's interaction models and The David Project's UI/UX approaches.
