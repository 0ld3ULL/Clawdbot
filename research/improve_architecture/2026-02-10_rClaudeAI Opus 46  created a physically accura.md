After two years making experiments with LLMs on computational engineering and physics, the results for this project and how fast and attractive it was simply amazed me. Just one session of Antigravity with Opus 4.6 made a complete FVM-PIC Simulation of a fusion reactor, meanwhile models one year ago struggled to make simple PIC (Particle In Cell) simulations.

I jave no doubts that this models would help to accelerate science in many ways.
