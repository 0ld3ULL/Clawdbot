## Summary

[TRENDING] A game developer sharing insights on user engagement and game sharing mechanics for a daily puzzle game. Highlights challenges in getting users to share game progress and performance metrics.

## Content

I launched a logic puzzle game a few days ago (daily web game like Wordle) that blends concepts from Sudoku, Chess, Nonograms, and Star Battles/Queens. It's doing really well, people are coming back every day and they tell me it's great, but nobody is hitting the share button. Literally 1k players yesterday and not one person used the in-game sharing prompt. That feels insane! Is that just normal for puzzle games? Is there a best-in-class sharing practice I'm missing?

I can't attach a photo, but the share prompt has your score, your score in relation to other players (e.g. "you're in the top 2%"), and the time it took you to complete. The game is [tileknight.com](http://tileknight.com) if anybody has ideas to improve the sharing prompt (prompt appears after beating any of the daily puzzles)

## Analysis

Useful for understanding user engagement strategies in DEVA and Amphitheatre, particularly around social sharing, game design for daily interactions, and motivation mechanics. Could inform David Flip's social media interaction design.
