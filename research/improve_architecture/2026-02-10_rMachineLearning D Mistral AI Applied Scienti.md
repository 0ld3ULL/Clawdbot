Hi Everyone 

Hope you all are doing well.

  
I got shortlisted for the Applied Scientist/ Research Engineer role at Mistral Singapore. They contacted me today and told me they will be having a phone call type of round this week itself if I want to proceed. And they said that it will be based on your previous research experiences and coding.

Now I have read many experiences on various sites, but the difference between the interview questions is wild.

  
If any of you have interviewed with Mistral AI, kindly share your experience.

  
My Background:

Master's in AI from a top IIT

4 Research Papers.. (3 EMNLP, 1 ICLR). EMNLP papers are mostly on low-resource machine translation and AI safety, and the ICLR paper is on developmental interpretability.

Previous Research Internship at Sony AI.

Score: 94 | Comments: 9

## Analysis

The candidate's research in AI safety and low-resource machine translation could offer valuable insights for The David Project's architectural development and ethical AI considerations. The technical depth of their academic work and internship at Sony AI suggests potential strategies for advanced AI agent design.
