## Summary

[TRENDING] A collaborative experiment with multiple Claude AI agents demonstrated the potential for complex, coordinated software development tasks through multi-agent collaboration, specifically creating a functional C compiler by dividing complex work across specialized agents.

## Content

The $20,000 experiment compiled a Linux kernel but needed deep human management.

## Analysis

Directly relevant to The David Project's multi-agent architecture, shows advanced coordination capabilities of Claude agents in software engineering, provides insights into breaking down complex coding tasks across specialized AI agents
