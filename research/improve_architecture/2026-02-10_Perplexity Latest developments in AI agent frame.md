## Summary

[TRENDING] Multiple AI agent frameworks are emerging in 2024-2025, offering advanced multi-agent orchestration and modular design for complex AI systems. These tools provide scalable architectures for building collaborative, stateful AI workflows across various domains.

## Content

**Leading AI agent frameworks in 2024-2025 include LangChain/LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen (Microsoft), Semantic Kernel, Vellum, OpenAI Agents, and emerging open-source options like Auto-GPT, SuperAGI, LlamaIndex, and OpenAI Swarm, focusing on multi-agent orchestration, enterprise governance, and stateful workflows.** [1][2][4][5][6]

These frameworks enable developers to build modular, scalable AI systems for tasks like automation, data analysis, and collaborative decision-making, accelerating development while reducing complexity.[1][2][4]

### Top Frameworks and Strengths
| Framework | Key Strengths | Best For | Citations |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| **LangChain/LangGraph** | Modular ecosystem, RAG/memory support, stateful orchestration, human-in-the-loop, integrates with LangSmith. | Semantic search, enterprise workflows, compliance (e.g., Klarna's 80% faster support). | [1][2][4][5] |
| **CrewAI** | Role-based multi-agent teams, sequential/hierarchical execution, visual design. | Structured teams for market analysis, research. | [1][2][4] |
| **AutoGen (Microsoft)** | Multi-agent collaboration, real-time chat, self-reflection, A2A protocol support. | Conversational AI, data workflows (e.g., Novo Nordisk). | [1][2][3][4][6] |
| **Semantic Kernel (Microsoft)** | Microsoft integration, multi-agent SDK in Azure AI Foundry. | Large enterprises with Azure. | [1][3] |
| **Vellum** | Visual builder, evals, governance (RBAC, audits), flexible deployment. | Production-scale with compliance. | [2] |
| **OpenAI Agents/Swarm** | API-first, tool calling, model upgrades. | GPT-centric, simple agent building. | [2][4] |

Other notables: **LlamaIndex** (data indexing), **Auto-GPT** (autonomous recursion/memory), **SuperAGI** (GUI/toolkits for production).[4][5][6]

### Key Trends in 2025-2026
- **Multi-agent systems**: Shift to coordinated agents at scale, with standards like Salesforce/Google A2A and Microsoft MCP for interoperability.[2][3]
- **Enterprise governance**: Emphasis on RBAC, audit trails, observability (e.g., Azure AI Foundry metrics for safety/cost).[2][3]
- **Advanced capabilities**: Parallel computing, self-learning via feedback, long-term memory, streaming support; move beyond rigid tasks to adaptive reasoning.[1][5]
- **Open-source momentum**: Frameworks like LangGraph show real-world wins (e.g., Elastic SecOps), outperforming singles on benchmarks like GAIA.[5][6]

Microsoft's Azure AI Foundry (GA at Build 2025) unifies Semantic Kernel/AutoGen for complex orchestration with observability.[3] Future directions include self-improving frameworks and hardware-optimized scheduling.[1] Sources note rapid evolution, with 2026 trends building on 2025 pilots toward production multi-agent deployments.[2][5]

## Analysis

Direct relevance for The David Project's autonomous agent system, potential improvements in DEVA's multi-agent capabilities, and exploring advanced orchestration patterns for AI interactions across all projects. CrewAI and AutoGen particularly offer insights into role-based and collaborative AI agent design.
