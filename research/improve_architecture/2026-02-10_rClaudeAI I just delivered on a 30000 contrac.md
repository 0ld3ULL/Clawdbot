## Summary

[TRENDING] A developer successfully used Claude AI to complete a $30,000 contract by focusing on software design principles and 'vibe coding', demonstrating the potential of AI coding assistants for rapid project development and entrepreneurship.

## Content

!!! Not a flex, I am just extremely proud of myself and excited for the future, and wanted to share this with someone.

Quick TLDR on me, I've been vibe coding for about 2 years now, starting with chatGPT back during the Xmas of 2023 when I tried to copy/paste code it gave me, editing myself with my limited software engineering knowledge (I have a cyber/pentesting background) but the core principles were ingrained from my studies in good software design practices.

  
Over these years I have really felt that the core to writing good code, is understanding what good software looks like and how to think about designing and building the software NOT the code that it is written in.

I can say that I have proven to myself that yes, this is now true. I proved to myself that I can start my own business purely from vibes, I can make anything I want from 'vibes'. What people used to look down on, is now the norm and I can't wait to say 'I told you so', but at the same time, I am also so busy, and so excited for the future that I don't even have time to rub anyone's face in it.

I've just finished my second vibe-coding job and have net revenue the last 3 months of $33,000 AUD purely from vibes, and I just wanted to make this post to show anyone in my position just a few months ago, that you will all make it. 

I know you have seen others post about this, but the proof really is in the pudding, just build shit, make it yours, think like a developer, think bigger than what is holding you back. Think about 'what would I do if I was in the position I want to be in', for me it was, a founder of my own business that builds and delivers using AI, primarily Claude Code.

  
So I want to say thank you so much to Anthropic for making my dreams a reality, I always saw posts on reddit like this and I never thought I would be one to make the post myself.

I am still early on in my journey, and am very busy with the business but I love to build, and I am focusing more on open source projec

## Analysis

The post highlights Claude's practical utility for software development, particularly relevant for The David Project's autonomous agent architecture and potential code generation capabilities. The emphasis on understanding software design over specific code syntax aligns with our approach to building intelligent systems.
