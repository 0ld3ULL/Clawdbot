## Summary

Game development insights showing the critical importance of user experience and playtesting, revealing how developers can misunderstand player interaction. Key lesson is to focus on intuitive design and user-friendly mechanics that players naturally discover.

For context: my game is realistic nature places cleaning sim named Eco Volunteer, and its demo been out a week ago and I watched about 20 streams so far. Watching streams all days, fixing bugs all nights - that was intense week! Sometime I has to be in streamer's chat and write him hints how to do some things in the game. But I realized that some game mechanics on which I worked for weeks was totally ignored by streamers, and most of the streamers played my game not the way I expected:

* Streamers played my demo very slow, so it took more than 3 hours for them to finish it. I had to  be in streamer's chat all that time and tell them which button to press, what to do (even though they had read the tutorial before and button descriptions were on screen all the time). 
* None of the streamers spent almost any energy and, accordingly, they did not need the food and sofa for energy restoration that were sold in the store
* Some streamers spent over an hour running on foot and only then remembered that there was a car in the game.
* Some streamers were afraid to go back to base when they ran out of resources because thought that all progress will be lost
* Only one streamer used fast travel, and nobody used "zoom" option
* Nobody mentioned swarm of flies over the garbage bin, I worked 2 days on it
* Nobody tried to enter the pond on a car. I worked on splashes, waves and bubbles about a week
* Only 1 streamer mentioned ants and anthills in the groves, nobody noticed butterflies over the flowers and fish in the pond
* Most streamers paid a lot of attention to sorting garbage, and wanted more features related to it
* Some streamers decided that the fog was smoke from a fire and went to look for the fire in that place.
* I saw some weird bugs and glitches related to PC specs that not appeared while I was testing the game on my PC
* I have 16 colors for car paint in in-game e-shop, but all the streamers picked only one color except default (guess which)
* one streamer sugges

## Analysis

For Amphitheatre and DEVA, this demonstrates the need for extensive user testing, clear UI/UX design, and understanding how players actually interact with game mechanics versus developer expectations. The insights could help refine interaction models and reduce friction in user experience.
