## Summary

Experience report on mobile game development using outsourced team, highlighting project management, communication strategies, and budgeting for a Unity-based mobile game project.

## Content

My game goes live on App Store and Google Play in about 3 weeks and I'm nervous as hell but also excited. This is my first real game and I outsourced development to a studio in India called NipsApp Game Studios.

Background: I'm not a programmer. I do marketing for a SaaS company. Had a game idea for 2 years, tried learning Unity myself for 6 months and made basically nothing playable. Decided to outsource.

**Why I'm posting this:**

Saw a lot of questions about outsourcing game dev and whether it works. My experience was mostly positive but not perfect. Figured I'd share real numbers and what actually happened.

**The game:**

2D puzzle game with physics mechanics. Think Cut the Rope meets Monument Valley but simpler. 60 levels at launch. Targeting casual mobile players.

**Budget and timeline:**

* Contract: $12,000 for development
* Actual spent: $14,500 (scope changes on my end)
* Timeline: 4.5 months (original estimate was 3.5 months)

**Total project cost: $14,500**

**What went well:**

The team was transparent about costs. When I asked for features outside the original scope (I wanted a hint system added halfway through), they gave me a quote within 24 hours. $1,200 extra. I approved it. No surprise bills.

Communication was fine. We did weekly video calls. Time zone difference (I'm in California, they're in India) meant calls were at 7am my time but that worked.

Quality of work is solid. The game feels polished. Animations are smooth. No major bugs in the beta test we ran with 50 people.

They handled iOS and Android builds, which saved me from learning that nightmare.

**What was harder than expected:**

I underestimated how much I needed to be involved. This wasn't "pay money, get game." I had to:

* Review builds every week
* Make design decisions constantly (UI placement, difficulty balancing, color schemes)
* Write all the copy for menus, tutorials, App Store descriptions
* Organize beta testing myself
