Dangerously unchecked surveillance and rights violations have been a throughline of the Department of Homeland Security since the agency’s creation in the wake of the September 11th attacks. In particular, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have been responsible for countless civil liberties and digital rights violations since that time.

Just last week, the Associated Press reported a leaked ICE memo that authorizes agents to enter homes solely based on “administrative” warrants—lacking any judicial involvement. This government policy is contrary to the “very core”

Reveals systemic surveillance expansion by federal agencies, demonstrates technology being used to track and potentially control populations under guise of immigration enforcement. Shows how surveillance tools create infrastructure for broad social control beyond stated purpose, enabling targeted tracking of individuals across digital and physical spaces.
