Baton Rouge Police Department has acquired a military-grade surveillance drone originally designed for war zones, expanding local law enforcement's ability to conduct mass aerial surveillance of civilian populations. This represents a direct militarization of policing technology with unprecedented tracking capabilities.

The Baton Rouge Police Department announced this week that it will begin using a drone designed by military equipment manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Edge Autonomy, making it one of the first local police departments to use an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a history of primary use in foreign war zones. Baton Rouge is now one of the first local police departments in the United States to deploy an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with such extensive surveillance capabilities — a dangerous escalation in the militarization of local law enforcement. This is a troubling development in an already long history of local law enforcement acquiring and utilizing military-grade surveillance equipment. It should be a cautionary tale that prods communities across the country to be proactive in ensuring that drones can only be acquired and used in ways that are well-documented, transparent, and subject to public feedback. Baton Rouge bought the Stalker VXE30 from Edge Autonomy, which partners with Lockheed Martin and began operating under the brand Redwire this week. According to reporting from WBRZ ABC2 in Louisiana, the drone, training, and batteries, cost about $1 million.

All of the regular concerns surrounding drones apply to this new one in use by Baton Rouge: Drones can access and view spaces that are otherwise off-limits to law enforcement, including backyards, decks, and other areas of personal property. Footage captured by camera-enabled drones may be stored and shared in ways that go far beyond the initial flight. Additional camera-based surveillance can be installed on the drone, including automated license plate readers and the retroactive application of biometric analysis, such as face recognition. However, the use of a military-grade drone hypercharges these concerns. Stalker VXE30's surveillan

## Analysis

Military-grade drone represents a critical expansion of urban surveillance infrastructure, allowing unprecedented aerial monitoring of citizens without warrant. The Stalker VXE30 provides long-range visual tracking capabilities that blur the line between military and civilian surveillance, enabling potential mass population monitoring with minimal legal oversight.
