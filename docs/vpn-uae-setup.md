# VPN Setup in UAE (Android)

VPN apps are blocked on Play Store in UAE. Download APK directly from provider websites.

## Option A: Proton VPN (FREE)

1. Phone browser → `https://protonvpn.com/download-android`
2. Tap **Download APK** (not Play Store)
3. Allow install from unknown sources when prompted
4. Install, create free account, connect to US server

## Option B: ExpressVPN (Paid, reliable)

1. Subscribe at `https://www.expressvpn.com`
2. Download APK from account dashboard
3. Install, sign in, connect to US

## Option C: NordVPN (Paid, best obfuscation)

1. Subscribe at `https://nordvpn.com`
2. Download APK from their site
3. **Settings → Protocol → OpenVPN** (NordLynx blocked by Etisalat)
4. Enable **Obfuscated Servers**
5. Connect to US

## Critical UAE Tips

- **Use OpenVPN protocol** — default protocols get blocked by Etisalat
- **Enable obfuscation/stealth mode** — hides VPN usage
- Proton free tier has unlimited bandwidth — good for testing

## For Tello eSIM

Once VPN connected to US:
1. Go to Tello website
2. Sign up with US address (mail forwarding service works)
3. Purchase eSIM plan
4. Activate via emailed QR code
