## Summary

Discord plans to implement mandatory facial recognition or government ID verification globally by 2026, effectively creating a digital identity checkpoint for online communication platforms. This move represents a significant expansion of mandatory digital identification that could exclude users who cannot or will not submit biometric data.

I wanted to share this here because I assume we have a couple of developers here who make adult games/have an age-restricted Discord server and this can be relevant for marketing or communicating with your playerbase.  
Either you verify yourself and hope that many users do as well (which I doubt), or you switch platforms.  
I really only have two alternatives at mind. It is either Telegram because it has the largest user base or Stoat, which is basically a copy of Discord: [https://github.com/stoatchat](https://github.com/stoatchat)

## Analysis

This reveals a critical infrastructure for digital identity control, forcing users to surrender biometric data or lose platform access. It's a direct mechanism for tracking, identifying, and potentially silencing users under the guise of age verification, creating a choke point for online communication and effectively implementing a digital ID system.
