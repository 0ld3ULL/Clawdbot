## Summary

Cities are recognizing their procurement power to reject surveillance technologies like automatic license plate readers (ALPRs), challenging the 'legacy procurement' methods that vendors use to normalize invasive monitoring systems. By rejecting these technologies at the municipal level, local governments are disrupting the expansion of surveillance infrastructure.

In 2025, elected officials across the country began treating surveillance technology purchases differently: not as inevitable administrative procurements handled by police departments, but as political decisions subject to council oversight and constituent pressure. This shift proved to be the most effective anti-surveillance strategy of the year. Since February, at least 23 jurisdictions fully ended, cancelled, or rejected Flock Safety ALPR programs (including Austin, Oak Park, Evanston, Hays County, San Marcos, Eugene, Springfield, and Denver) by recognizing surveillance procurement as political power, not administrative routine.

Vendors exploit this inertia through the "pilot loophole."

For local electeds, the pressure to "outsource" government decision-making makes vendor marketing compelling. Vendors use "cooperative purchasing" agreements to bypass competitive bidding, effectively privatizing the policy-making process. The result is a dangerous "information asymmetry" where cities b

## Analysis

Reveals a critical vulnerability in the surveillance state: municipal procurement processes can be a powerful point of resistance against pervasive tracking technologies. The article exposes how vendors exploit bureaucratic inertia to install monitoring systems, and shows emerging grassroots strategies to block their implementation.
