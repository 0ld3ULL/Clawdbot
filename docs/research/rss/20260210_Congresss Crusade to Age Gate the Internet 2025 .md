## Summary

Congress proposed multiple age verification bills that would create invasive digital ID systems, potentially exposing everyone's online identity and enabling unprecedented surveillance and censorship infrastructure. These bills represent a Trojan horse for mass tracking under the guise of child protection.

In the name of 'protecting kids online,' Congress pushed forward legislation this year that could have severely undermined our privacy and stifled free speech. These bills would have mandated invasive age-verification checks for everyone online—adults and kids alike—handing unprecedented control to tech companies and government authorities. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle introduced bill after bill, each one somehow more problematic than the last, and each one a gateway for massive surveillance, internet censorship, and government overreach. In all, Congress considered nearly twenty federal proposals. For us, this meant a year of playing legislative whack-a-mole, fighting off one bad bill after another. But more importantly, it meant building sustained opposition, strengthening coalitions, and empowering our supporters—that's you!—with the tools you need to understand what's at stake and take action. Luckily, thanks to this strong opposition, these federal efforts all stalled… for now. So, before we hang our hats and prepare for the new year, let’s review some of our major wins against federal age-verification legislation in 2025. The Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) Of the dozens of federal proposals relating to kids online, the Kids Online Safety Act remains the biggest threat. We, along with a coalition of civil liberties groups, LGBTQ+ advocates, youth organizations, human rights advocates, and privacy experts, have been sounding the alarm on KOSA for years now. First introduced in 2022, KOSA would allow the Federal Trade Commission to sue apps and websites that don’t take measures to restrict young people’s access to certain content. There have been numerous versions introduced, though all of them share a common core: KOSA is an unconstitutional censorship bill that threatens the speech and privacy rights of all internet users. It would impose a requirement that platforms “exercise reasonable care” to prevent and mitigate a sweeping list of harms to minors,

Age verification legislation creates a universal digital identification system that can be weaponized for social control, tracking, and potentially silencing dissent by linking online activity to real-world identity. The proposed bills would give governments and tech companies unprecedented power to monitor and restrict internet access.
