Federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have descended into utter lawlessness, most recently in Minnesota. The violence is shocking. So are the intrusions on digital rights. For example, we have a First Amendment right to record on-duty police, including ICE and CBP, but federal agents are violating this right. Indeed, Alex Pretti was exercising this right shortly before federal agents shot and killed him. So were the many people who filmed agents shooting and killing Pretti and Renee Good – thereby creating valuable evidence that contradicts false claims by government leaders. To protect our digital rights, we need the rule of law. When an armed agent of the government breaks the law, the civilian they injure must be made whole. This includes a lawsuit by the civilian (or their survivor) against the agent, seeking money damages to compensate them for their injury. Such systems of accountability encourage agents to follow the law, whereas impunity encourages them to break it. Unfortunately, there is a gaping hole in the rule of law: when a federal agent violates the U.S. Constitution, it is increasingly difficult to sue them for damages. For these reasons, EFF supports new statutes to fill this hole, including California S.B. 747. The Problem In 1871, at the height of Reconstruction following the Civil War, Congress enacted a landmark statute empowering people to sue state and local officials who violated their constitutional rights. This was a direct response to state-sanctioned violence against Black people that continued despite the formal end of slavery. The law is codified today at 42 U.S.C. § 1983. However, there is no comparable statute empowering people to sue federal officials who violate the U.S. Constitution. So in 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court stepped into this gap, in a watershed case called Bivens v. Six Unknown FBI Agents. The plaintiff alleged that FBI agents unlawfully searched his home
