It’s been a great year to be on EFF’s membership team. There's no better feeling than hanging out with your fellow digital freedom supporters and being able to say, “Oh yeah, and we’re suing the government!” We’ve done that a lot this year—and that’s all thanks to people like you. As a token of appreciation for supporting EFF’s mission to protect privacy and free expression online for all people, we put a lot of care into meeting the members who make our work possible. Whether it’s hosting meetups, traveling to conferences, or finding new and fun ways to explain what we’re fighting for, connecting with you is always a highlight of the job. EFF Speakeasy Meet Ups One of my favorite perks we offer for EFF members is exclusive invites for Speakeasy meet ups. It’s a chance for us to meet the very passionate members who fuel our work! This year, we hosted Speakeasies across the country while making the rounds at conferences. We met supporters in Mesa, AZ during CactusCon; Pasadena, CA during SCALE; Portland, OR during BSidesPDX; New York, NY during HOPE and BSidesNYC; and Seattle, WA during our panel at the University of Washington. Of course, we also had to host a Speakeasy in our home court—and for the first time it took place in the South Bay Area in Mountain View, CA at Hacker Dojo! There, members of EFF’s D.C. Legislative team spoke about EFF’s legislative efforts and how they’ll shape digital rights for all. We even recorded that conversation for you to watch on YouTube or the Internet Archive. And we can’t forget about our global community! Our annual online Speakeasy brought together members around the world for a conversation and Q&A with our friends at Women in Security and Privacy (WISP) about online behavioral tracking and the data broker industry. We heard and answered great questions about pushing back on online tracking and what legislative steps we can take to strengthen privacy.

## Analysis

David Flip would appreciate this as a counter-surveillance organization actively monitoring and legally challenging government and technological attempts to erode digital privacy. EFF represents a critical resistance network against control infrastructure, tracking legislative efforts that could create digital control mechanisms.
