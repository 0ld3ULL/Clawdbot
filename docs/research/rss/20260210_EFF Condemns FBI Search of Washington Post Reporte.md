FBI conducted an invasive search of a Washington Post reporter's home, seizing digital devices and potentially intimidating press freedom. This represents a direct governmental assault on journalistic independence and the First Amendment.

## Original Content

Government invasion of a reporter’s home, and seizure of journalistic materials, is exactly the kind of abuse of power the First Amendment is designed to prevent. It represents the most extreme form of press intimidation. Yet, that’s what happened on Wednesday morning to Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson, when the FBI searched her Virginia home and took her phone, two laptops, and a Garmin watch. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has joined 30 other press freedom and civil liberties organizations in condemning the FBI’s actions against Natanson. The First Amendment exists precisely to prevent the government from using its powers to punish or deter reporting on matters of public interest—including coverage of leaked or sensitive information. Searches like this threaten not only journalists, but the public’s right to know what its government is doing. In the statement published yesterday, we call on Congress: To exercise oversight of the DOJ by calling Attorney General Pam Bondi before Congress to answer questions about the FBI’s actions; To reintroduce and pass the PRESS Act, which would limit government surveillance of journalists, and its ability to compel journalists to reveal sources; To reform the 108-year-old Espionage Act so it can no longer be used to intimidate and attack journalists. And to pass a resolution confirming that the recording of law enforcement activity is protected by the First Amendment. We’re joined on this letter by Free Press Action, the American Civil Liberties Union, PEN America, the NewsGuild-CWA, the Society of Professional Journalists, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and many other press freedom and civil liberties groups.

## Analysis

This incident reveals an escalating pattern of government attempts to suppress independent reporting by directly threatening journalists' privacy and ability to protect sources. The search represents a critical infrastructure of press control, using legal mechanisms to chill investigative journalism and create a chilling effect on potential whistleblowers and media transparency.
