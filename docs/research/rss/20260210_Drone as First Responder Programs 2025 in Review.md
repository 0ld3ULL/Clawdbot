## Summary

Law enforcement is rapidly expanding autonomous drone surveillance infrastructure, creating a pervasive real-time monitoring system that can automatically dispatch camera-equipped drones to emergency calls with minimal human intervention. The FAA is streamlining approval processes, enabling widespread deployment of persistent aerial surveillance technology.

Drone as first responder (DFR) adoption really took off in 2025. Though the concept has been around since 2018, this year saw more normalization of the technology, its integration into more real-time crime center structures, and the implementation of automated deployment of drones. A DFR program features a fleet of camera-equipped drones, which can range from just a couple to dozens or more. These are deployed from a launch pad in response to 911 calls and other calls for service, sometimes operated by a drone pilot or, increasingly, autonomously directed to the call location. The appeal is the promise of increased “situational awareness” for officers headed to a call. This video offers a short explanation of DFR, and for a list of all of the cities we know use drones, including DFR programs, check out EFF’s Atlas of Surveillance. Major Moves from the FAA and Forthcoming Federal Issues In order to deploy a drone beyond where it can be seen, operators need to receive a waiver from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and all DFR programs require this. Police departments and technology vendors have complained that the process takes too long, and in May, FAA finalized reworked requirements, leading to a flood of waiver requests. An FAA spokesperson reported that in the first two months of the new waiver process, it had approved 410 such waivers, already accounting for almost a third of the approximately 1,400 DFR waivers that had ever been granted. The federal government made other major moves on the drone front this year. A month after the new waivers went to effect, President Trump issued an Executive Order with aspirations for advancing the country’s drone industry. And at the end of the year, one of the largest drone manufacturers in the world and one of the biggest purveyors of law enforcement drones, DJI, will be banned from launching new products in the U.S. unless the federal government conducts a security audit that was mandated by the National Defense A

## Analysis

Reveals expanding surveillance state infrastructure with autonomous tracking capabilities, reduces human oversight in monitoring, creates permanent aerial observation network that can be weaponized for broad population control and behavior tracking. The ease of waiver acquisition and autonomous deployment represent significant steps toward normalized, ubiquitous surveillance.
