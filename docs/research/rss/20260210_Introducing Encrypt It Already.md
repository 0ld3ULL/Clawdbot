## Summary

[TRENDING] Electronic Frontier Foundation launches campaign pushing tech companies to implement stronger end-to-end encryption, targeting major platforms like WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, and Apple to prevent unauthorized data access and protect user privacy from corporate surveillance.

## Original Content

Today, we’re launching Encrypt It Already, our push to get companies to offer stronger privacy protections to our data and communications by implementing end-to-end encryption. If that name sounds a little familiar, it’s because this is a spiritual successor to our 2019 campaign, Fix It Already, a campaign where we pushed companies to fix longstanding issues. End-to-end encryption is the best way we have to protect our conversations and data. It ensures the company that provides a service cannot access the data or messages you store on it. So, for secure chat apps like WhatsApp and Signal, that means the company that makes those apps cannot see the contents of your messages, and they’re only accessible on your and your recipients. When it comes to data, like what’s stored using Apple’s Advanced Data Protection, it means you control the encryption keys and the service provider will not be able to access the data. We’ve divided this up into three categories, each with three different demands: Keep your Promises: Features that the company has publicly stated they’re working on, but which haven’t launched yet. Facebook should use end-to-end encryption for group messages Apple and Google should deliver on their promise of interoperable end-to-end encryption of RCS Bluesky should launch its promised end-to-end encryption for DMs Defaults Matter: Features that are available on a service or in app already, but aren’t enabled by default. Telegram should default to end-to-end encryption for DMs WhatsApp should use end-to-end encryption for backups by default Ring should enable end-to-end encryption for its cameras by default Protect Our Data: New features that companies should launch, often because their competition is doing it already. Google should launch end-to-end encryption for Google Authenticator backups Google should offer end-to-end encryption for Android backup data Apple and Google should offer an AI permissions per app option to block AI access to secure chat apps

## Matched Goals

## Analysis

David Flip would see this as a critical resistance effort against digital surveillance infrastructure. By pushing for end-to-end encryption, the campaign directly challenges the ability of corporations and governments to access personal communications, which is a core mechanism of social control. The initiative specifically targets default settings and promised features that could close existing surveillance loopholes.
