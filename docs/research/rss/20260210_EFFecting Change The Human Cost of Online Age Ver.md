## Summary

Age verification laws are creating pervasive digital surveillance infrastructure that requires invasive personal data collection and biometric scanning for internet access. These mandates effectively build a comprehensive system of online tracking and control under the guise of child protection.

## Original Content

Age verification mandates are spreading fast, and they’re ushering in a new age of online surveillance, censorship, and exclusion for everyone—not just young people. Age-gating laws generally require websites and apps to collect sensitive data from every user, often through invasive tools like ID checks, biometric scans, or other dubious “estimation” methods, before granting them access to certain content or services. Lawmakers tout these laws as the silver-bullet solution to “kids’ online safety,” but in reality, age-verification mandates wall off large swaths of the web, build sweeping new surveillance infrastructure, increase the risk of data breaches and real-life privacy harms, and threaten the anonymity that has long allowed people to seek support, explore new ideas, and organize and build community online.Join EFF's Rindala Alajaji and Alexis Hancock along with Hana Memon from Gen-Z for Change and Cynthia Conti-Cook from Collaborative Research Center for Resilience for a conversation about what we stand to lose as more and more governments push to age-gate the web. We’ll break down how these laws work, who they exclude, and how these mandates threaten privacy and free expression for people of all ages. The conversation will be followed by a live Q&A.

## Analysis

These laws establish a universal digital ID system that tracks and gates internet access, creating granular surveillance infrastructure. By requiring invasive personal verification for online services, governments can potentially isolate, exclude, or control individuals based on their digital identity and behavior.
