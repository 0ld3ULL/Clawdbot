## Summary

Local communities are successfully blocking automated license plate reader (ALPR) surveillance by leveraging procurement power, grassroots organizing, and technical research to disrupt surveillance infrastructure at the municipal level. These campaigns are systematically undermining surveillance tech deployment by targeting contracts and vendor relationships.

Across ideologically diverse communities, 2025 campaigns against automated license plate reader (ALPR) surveillance kept winning. From Austin, Texas to Cambridge, Massachusetts to Eugene, Oregon, successful campaigns combined three practical elements: a motivated political champion on city council, organized grassroots pressure from affected communities, and technical assistance at critical decision moments. The 2025 Formula for Refusal Institutional Authority: Council members leveraging "procurement power"—local democracy's most underutilized tool—to say no. Community Mobilization: A base that refuses to debate "better policy" and demands "no cameras." Shared Intelligence: Local coalitions utilizing shared research on contract timelines and vendor breaches. Practical Wins Over Perfect Policies In 2025, organizers embraced the "ugly" win: prioritizing immediate contract cancellations over the "political purity" of perfect privacy laws. Procurement fights are often messy, bureaucratic battles rather than high-minded legislative debates, but they stop surveillance where it starts—at the checkbook. In Austin, more than 30 community groups built a coalition that forced a contract cancellation, achieving via purchasing power what policy reform often delays. In Hays County, Texas, the victory wasn't about a new law, but a contract termination. Commissioner Michelle Cohen grounded her vote in vendor accountability, explaining: "It's more about the company's practices versus the technology." These victories might lack the permanence of a statute, but every camera turned off built a culture of refusal that made the next rejection easier. This was the organizing principle: take the practical win and build on it. Start with the Harm Winning campaigns didn't debate technical specifications or abstract privacy principles. They started with documented harms that surveillance enabled. EFF's research showing police used Flock's network to track Romani people with discriminatory sea
