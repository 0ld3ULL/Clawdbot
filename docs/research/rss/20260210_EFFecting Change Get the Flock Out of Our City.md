## Summary

Flock's Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) technology represents a massive surveillance infrastructure enabling tracking of individuals across cities, with specific capabilities to monitor sensitive populations like abortion seekers and protesters. These systems create granular movement tracking that can be weaponized for political and social control.

## Original Content

Flock contracts have quietly spread to cities across the country. But Flock ALPR (Automated License Plate Readers) erode civil liberties from the moment they're installed. While officials claim these cameras keep neighborhoods safe, the evidence tells a different story. The data reveals how Flock has enabled surveillance of people seeking abortions, protesters exercising First Amendment rights, and communities targeted by discriminatory policing. This is exactly why cities are saying no. From Austin to Cambridge to small towns across Texas, jurisdictions are rejecting Flock contracts altogether, proving that surveillance isn't inevitable—it's a choice. Join EFF's Sarah Hamid and Andrew Crocker along with Reem Suleiman from Fight for the Future and Kate Bertash from Rural Privacy Coalition to explore what's happening as Flock contracts face growing resistance across the U.S. We'll break down the legal implications of the data these systems collect, examine campaigns that have successfully stopped Flock deployments, and discuss the real-world consequences for people's privacy and freedom. The conversation will be followed by a live Q&A. EFFecting Change Livestream Series:Get the Flock Out of Our CityThursday, February 19th12:00 PM - 1:00 PM PacificThis event is LIVE and FREE!

## Analysis

Reveals systemic surveillance technology that can track individuals' movements, potentially enabling targeted suppression of civil liberties by mapping protest activities, personal medical choices, and demographic movements. The technology creates a pervasive tracking grid that can be used to 'switch off' or marginalize specific groups by mapping their physical presence and mobility patterns.
