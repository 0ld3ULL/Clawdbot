**Recent developments on CBDCs highlight tensions between surveillance risks, privacy protections, and digital ID integration, with U.S. legislation advancing to block CBDCs amid fears of a "surveillance state," while global designs emphasize privacy features.** [1][2][3][4]

### U.S. Legislative Push Against CBDC Surveillance
The **Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act** progressed significantly in 2025: S.1124 was introduced in the Senate on March 25, prohibiting Federal Reserve banks from issuing CBDCs directly or indirectly, testing them, or using them for monetary policy, explicitly to prevent surveillance risks.[3] Its House counterpart, H.R.1919, passed the House on July 17, 2025, with identical prohibitions and an exception for open, permissionless, private digital assets mimicking cash privacy.[4] Critics like HRF warn CBDCs enable unprecedented central bank control, citing China's digital yuan—which mandates phone verification tied to real IDs for surveillance—as a model autocracies favor over democracies.[2]

### Privacy Opportunities and Risks in CBDC Design
The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) outlines **positive impacts** like privacy-by-design in a digital euro, potentially enhancing anonymity via technologies for lawful auditing (e.g., anti-money laundering) while giving users more data control than current digital payments.[1] Conversely, **negative risks** include data concentration at central banks inviting cyberattacks or mass surveillance, plus misuse of transaction data for profiling.[1] The Bank of England stresses its digital pound design excludes government access to personal spending data, requiring only wallet-provider ID checks under privacy regulations, without programmable restrictions on use.[5]

### Links to Digital ID and Surveillance Concerns
Digital IDs are increasingly tied to CBDC discussions for secure payments, combining identification, authentication, and authorization to boost access, fight fraud, and prevent money laund

## Analysis

Directly addresses emerging digital currency infrastructure that could enable granular financial surveillance, with specific legislative attempts to prevent a 'surveillance state' through digital ID and programmable money tracking. The mention of China's digital yuan as a surveillance model is particularly alarming, showing how CBDCs can become precise population control tools.
