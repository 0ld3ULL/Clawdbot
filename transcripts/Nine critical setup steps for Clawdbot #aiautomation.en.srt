1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,919
Here are the nine things you must do

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,240
when first setting up Cloudbot. First is

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,400
lock your project isolation. You must

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,120
force every project to have a project

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,360
ID. Second is create a master project

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,000
and this is your operating system. Next

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,000
is write project charters before you do

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,800
anything. That's your objective, your

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,080
scope in out guard rails and definitions

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,800
of success. Next, enforce no project ID,

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,320
no work. That is essential to make sure

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,279
it doesn't go off the rails. Number

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,680
five, install conflict detection so

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,760
it'll block if there is conflict

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,559
detected. Next, turn those conflicts

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,480
into log files in your conflicts folder.

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,559
Then pipe those errors directly into

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,719
your Messengerbot. I use Slack. Number

19
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,879
eight, define your severity levels up

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,960
front. Info, warn, block, reject,

21
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,800
critical. Lastly, kill anything that's

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,039
fast but wrong. We don't need that

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,280
behavior. We need safety over speed. If

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,719
you treat Cloudbot like Chat GPT, it's

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,480
going to burn you. If you treat it like

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,480
an operating system, it scales.
