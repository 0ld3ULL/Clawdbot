00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,560
Hey, this is Matt Ganzac and in this

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:07,200
video we are going over the AI software

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,320
blueprint. Creating prototypes in days,

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,679
not months, leveraging AI. First, a

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,519
little disclaimer we have to get out of

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,599
the way. Just by watching this video,

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,680
you are not guaranteed success by

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,560
implementing this training. You are not

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,439
guaranteed success. Results are not

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,279
always typical and nine out of 10en

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,359
software ventures fail in the first 18

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,359
months. According to Forbes.com,

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,679
business is risky. Always consult your

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,760
attorney and your accountant. All case

15
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,000
studies are true to the best of my

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,960
knowledge. Don't purchase anything from

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,520
me if you cannot afford it. Starting a

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,920
business is an investment and it takes

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,640
time. Software is not a get-richqu

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:51,840
scheme. Okay? It was all a dream. I

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,399
won't do any impersonations or anything,

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,640
but I built my first software platform

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,719
in 2006 and it sucked. But I'm pretty

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,960
sure it's still online today, exactly

25
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,799
how I originally built it in 2006. So

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,720
that must say something, right? I still

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,280
think it

28
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,840
sucked. Between 2008 and 2015, I worked

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,920
for one of the top 100 most visited

30
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,880
apps. Um, later on, like 2013, 2014, I

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,840
think we dropped to like top 500. But

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,680
when I got started in 2008, we built up

33
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,360
to be one of the most 100 most visited

34
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,799
websites, which is insane. like millions

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,720
and millions and millions and millions

36
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,960
of visitors every single day. It was

37
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,439
nuts. Since then, I've been launching

38
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,040
new software platforms and I never

39
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,200
dreamt in my wildest dreams that AI

40
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,439
would be writing software and writing

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,200
code. It's absolutely insane. Today, you

42
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,920
can get a software platform online in

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,560
days, not months. And the time to strike

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,040
is now, not tomorrow. The speed of which

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,119
if you're sitting on an idea right now,

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,360
the speed of which people are moving on

47
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:02,560
your ideas is insane. Like I can have an

48
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,960
idea in the morning by lunch I can have

49
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,680
it all validated and smoke test and

50
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,200
whatnot and by the end of the day I can

51
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,160
have it live people are using it. It's

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,800
insane. In a single day it's nuts. So

53
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,760
you need to get moving on this. Now, all

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:24,080
of this starts with a problem. All too

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:26,800
often, too many people think about way

56
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,520
too many things. And the only thing that

57
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,239
you need to focus on at the beginning

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:35,200
steps of your software venture, SAS,

59
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,440
app, whatever you want to call it, is a

60
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,840
problem. Solving a problem is essential

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,920
to successful software businesses.

62
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,000
Starting with the problem, you are

63
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:49,280
solving. Period. End of story.

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,959
Everything else is just trying to solve

65
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,440
the problem, but focus on the problem. I

66
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,840
cannot reiterate like people reach out

67
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,879
to me. Oh, I got this great idea. I

68
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,159
secured the domain and I have the

69
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,840
trademark pending and D and we got to do

70
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:09,200
this. We got to move on this. Well, what

71
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,040
problem are you solving? Problem? I just

72
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,800
have a great name. I bought a great

73
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,760
domain. We should build a product around

74
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,800
it. It's going to fail. That venture is

75
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,400
going to fail. I can guarantee you out

76
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,239
of the, you know, one out of 10

77
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,840
businesses that succeed, they're

78
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,680
focusing on the problem. Do not focus on

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,040
making money. That is not a problem.

80
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,120
Like your bank account reading very

81
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,760
little amount of money is not the

82
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,000
problem. It is not the problem. The

83
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,560
problem needs to be other people's bank

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,680
accounts that have money that are

85
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,920
willing to pay to solve a problem.

86
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,400
That's how you solve things. Money comes

87
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,480
after you solve the problem. You are

88
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,440
paid in direct proportion to the

89
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,640
difficulty of the problems you solve.

90
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,879
That's Elon Musk. I would listen to that

91
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,360
guy. He uh definitely knows what he's

92
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,720
talking about. I wrote a book in 2016. I

93
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,599
mentioned him several times. I've

94
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,599
always, you know, looked at the things

95
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,920
that he's built and the problems that

96
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,239
he's solved and the things that he's

97
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,359
tried to tackle. Regardless of what you

98
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,160
think of him, I think that it's insane.

99
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:23,360
I think it's insane. And I think that

100
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,160
going forward in thinking like people

101
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,639
like Elon Musk or thinking like you know

102
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,040
Richard Branson or thinking about things

103
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,000
in the way that other people that have

104
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,639
been very successful in solving problems

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,560
the way they think that's the way we

106
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,840
need to think that's how we need to move

107
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,360
so let's solve a problem we use chat

108
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:48,080
GPT03 to research problems chat GPT03 is

109
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,160
the model that uses reasoning the some

110
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,240
of the other models that are out there

111
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,240
are not using reasoning. And if you're

112
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,440
watching this years down the road and

113
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,240
they've updated, the key thing is we

114
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,919
want the advanced reasoning. We want it

115
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,919
to think. We just don't want it to read

116
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,320
the internet and just spit things back

117
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:10,320
out to us. We want it to read things on

118
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,960
the internet, analyze it, use reasoning,

119
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,720
and then give a response back. Uh I just

120
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,840
don't want things just spit out from the

121
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,600
internet. Right? So currently as I'm

122
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,639
making this video, chat GP03 is the

123
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,680
model that uses advanced reasoning. If

124
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,720
you do not have a problem worth solving

125
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,880
in your mind right now, use this prompt.

126
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,440
Give me 10 businesses and industries

127
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,000
that have huge problems that could be

128
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,680
solved using AI and they would be

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,759
willing to pay for these solutions. So,

130
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,360
if you don't want just 10 businesses,

131
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,440
you have a specific business that you

132
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,520
want to work on, just replace 10

133
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,840
businesses with give me 10 problems that

134
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,000
are worth solving in X business. So, you

135
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,080
can edit that prompt a little bit based

136
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,800
upon what you have. But if you have no

137
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,800
idea, you're starting at absolutely no

138
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,960
idea, you just know that you want to be

139
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,120
in the software business because it does

140
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,720
have great margins because you can have

141
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,280
great exits and you can make good money

142
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,000
from it if you do things correctly and

143
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,919
be part of that 10% of success. You can

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,919
be successful with it. But the key thing

145
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,400
is you need to ask it the right

146
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,520
questions. So let's review these

147
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,919
together. Okay, so I asked a question,

148
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,800
give me 10 businesses and industries

149
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,199
that have huge problems that could be

150
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,120
solved using AI and they would be

151
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,840
willing to pay for those. So it thinks

152
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,400
about it and it's like uh below or 10

153
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:45,919
gap analysis targets. Um number one,

154
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,160
hospital revenue, right? Um property and

155
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,960
casualty insurers. I'm actually building

156
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,039
software for I've already built it.

157
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,319
We're to market. were um valued at an

158
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:59,599
eight figureure company already and um I

159
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,639
literally did this one and I did this

160
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:06,639
one too. So this one's in development.

161
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,800
But point is like this is exactly how I

162
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,440
realize the opportunities that are out

163
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,520
there. So go find them. Go research. You

164
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,919
know, you can respond give me 10 more.

165
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,400
Like you can literally talk to this.

166
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,240
It'll respond back. It'll be smart.

167
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,479
It'll come up with ideas. It'll use some

168
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,479
reasoning, come up with some ideas and

169
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,960
so forth. Drill down, have a whole

170
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,280
conversation about it, and you're just

171
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,520
drilling down and trying to find

172
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,880
problems and solutions, and you can

173
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,880
develop those solutions. So, all too

174
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,960
often, people look at, you know, what

175
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,360
are the top 10 highest grossing software

176
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,520
businesses? Make me uh, you know,

177
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,400
duplicate. You know, I want to compete

178
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,479
with Mailchimp, for example. That's a

179
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,759
terrible way of going about this. You

180
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,840
are going to fail if you do that. Like

181
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,840
you have to look at problems that are

182
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,599
out there that are not currently solved.

183
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,680
If you're saying Mailchimp is too

184
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,840
expensive, I could build something that

185
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,680
you know is far less expensive and

186
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,360
people will switch from Mailchimp to me.

187
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,639
They will not. They will not. They will

188
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,080
not. Like it's a total waste of time and

189
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,440
you're going to waste money. You're

190
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,599
going to waste time. You're going to

191
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,240
waste your resources. is you're going to

192
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,720
waste everything trying to just rebuild

193
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,080
Mailchimp. It's a total waste of time.

194
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,160
Or the other idea is, well, you know, I

195
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,240
use this app for this and I use this app

196
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,560
for this and I use this app for this.

197
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,279
That should all be in one. Again,

198
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,000
terrible idea. It's a terrible idea

199
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,320
because you not only said you want to

200
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,399
recreate one app, but you want to

201
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,800
recreate three, four, five different

202
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,640
apps. All the features that are in all

203
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,920
these different apps and consolidated

204
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,080
into one. So companies are paying for,

205
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,120
you know, product A, product B, product

206
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,640
C, product D, and it's all integrated.

207
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,399
It's all working and, you know, they're

208
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,240
using it. Why would you try to compete

209
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,000
with four different products? That's

210
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,399
like you going and fighting four

211
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,160
different fights at the same time. It's

212
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,000
a terrible idea. It's a terrible waste

213
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:19,279
of time. So, the point is use this and

214
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,800
validate the idea. Come up with what it

215
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,640
is that you're solving, the problem

216
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,000
you're solving, and then from there,

217
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,600
like look at this thing. Like, it's

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,880
thinking. It's coming up with all these

219
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,959
different ideas. Here's some things.

220
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,399
Here's some things you can do, and

221
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,120
here's why they'll pay for it. So use

222
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,760
this brainstorm like instead of just

223
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,240
scrolling on Instagram or YouTube or

224
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,440
wherever Tik Tok you're scrolling open

225
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,800
up Chat GPT download it on your phone

226
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,800
switch over to the 03 model and ask it

227
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,120
questions just talk to it in the middle

228
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,760
of night when I can't fall asleep I'll

229
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,880
just open chat GPT and just brainstorm

230
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,120
and just come up with ideas. And this is

231
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,760
the best use of time when you have

232
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,920
downtime. It's not scrolling through

233
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,440
your, you know, feed just mindless. It's

234
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,760
brainstorming. It's coming up with

235
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,680
ideas. It's thinking about things. It's,

236
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,959
you know, challenging. So, you could

237
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,160
take one of these ideas like this idea

238
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,079
and you could challenge chat GPT. Like,

239
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,320
I don't think that this really is that

240
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,560
big of an opportunity. please explain

241
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,440
that opportunity scale to me a little

242
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,600
bit more so I better understand it and

243
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,360
it can drill down and and then you can

244
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,240
argue with it like this is the best

245
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,880
thing and then you could say long haul

246
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,519
trucking fleets and 3PL's

247
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,079
um I want to take this on but tell me

248
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,480
all the reasons why this is a bad idea

249
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,800
and it'll tell you what are the biggest

250
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,000
challenges that I'm going to face when

251
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,440
trying to you know take this on what are

252
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,800
some of the big challenges I'm going to

253
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,680
face here. What are the some of the big

254
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,839
challenges I'm going to face here? Like

255
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,480
ask it questions. Right? So often times

256
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:08,079
in in looking at these, you don't have a

257
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,640
ton of people to sell to, right? But if

258
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,200
they all have this problem that you're

259
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,680
trying to solve and they're willing to

260
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,320
pay for it and they're willing the the

261
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,640
problem cost them a lot of money, they

262
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,680
might be willing to pay a lot of money

263
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,800
for the service. So instead of having,

264
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,440
you know, one or two, you know, people

265
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,200
signing up per day at 30 bucks a month,

266
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,279
you could have one signing up every

267
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,360
quarter and they're paying you half

268
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,399
million to a million dollars a year per

269
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,800
client, per deal. Really makes a

270
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,440
difference as you can, you know, as you

271
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,120
can see here. Okay. So next, you have an

272
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,200
idea like you've done your research.

273
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,560
Let's just fast forward and say you've

274
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,959
done all this research and you feel

275
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,360
really good about something. What is a

276
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,519
good next step? If you do not want to go

277
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,600
at this alone, partner with somebody who

278
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,519
is an expert in that field. Somebody

279
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,760
that maybe works in the field, somebody

280
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,480
that has the problem, maybe a company

281
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,639
that's willing to pay for the software

282
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,320
development and then want to partner on

283
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,360
selling it to their competitors,

284
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,920
whatever. Be creative, come up with

285
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,160
ideas. And also another idea is perhaps

286
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,240
to attract partners, you could create

287
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,320
content talking about solutions and

288
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,720
talking about how you can create

289
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,079
solutions that you can create apps in

290
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,399
days, not months. You could create

291
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,279
content, put it out there and make a

292
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,360
call to action like if you're having a

293
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,360
problem in your current business and you

294
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,079
want to solve it with tech, message me

295
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,399
and let's talk about how we can solve

296
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,519
problems together. So, if you don't want

297
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,760
to go at this alone, then that's fine.

298
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,480
If you do want to go at this alone, then

299
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,560
do it. That's fine, too. But I found

300
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,240
that partnering in ventures, like I

301
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,880
said, I have a doctor. We're building

302
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,240
hospital software. I have a restaurant

303
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,639
owner. We're building restaurant

304
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,680
software. I have a sales professional.

305
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,120
We're building sales software. Um, when

306
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,480
you partner with people that are already

307
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,399
in the field, that already have the

308
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,959
problem, that already have people to

309
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,399
sell to and have the capital to put up

310
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,560
to do it, it really brings that capital,

311
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,880
knowledge, and connections all to the

312
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,839
table, which can really fast forward

313
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,600
your venture and the successes of your

314
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,160
venture is directly tied to those three

315
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,680
assets. So otherwise, you're looking for

316
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,800
the capital yourself, you're looking for

317
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,320
the knowledge yourself, and you're

318
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,399
looking for the connections yourself.

319
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,880
So, I like partnering with people, but

320
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,880
again, that's totally up to you. I like

321
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,200
asking experts what their problems are

322
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,200
facing and brainstorming ideas. So, if

323
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,880
you are going at this alone, you can

324
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,480
always do that and gain knowledge and

325
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,480
capital and so forth. Maybe give them

326
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,959
some equity in the deal. Structure a

327
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,200
deal, make it make sense, but know these

328
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,519
three assets, capital, knowledge, and

329
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:53,240
connections are essential to having a

330
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,839
successful software business. again use

331
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,399
chatb03 to come up with solutions to

332
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,920
these problems. So we go in there, we

333
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,000
focus on the problem solution, the

334
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,680
avatar and the TAM. So we're going to

335
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,480
talk about each one of those. We're

336
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,360
going to break those all down. Um first

337
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,199
ideal customer profile, ICP. Don't try

338
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,240
to reach everyone with what it is that

339
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,639
you're doing. Focus on a core customer

340
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,639
needs. For example, like I said, we're

341
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,360
building software for salespeople. We

342
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,440
niched down. We didn't say every

343
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,519
salesperson in the world, there are 5

344
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,360
million salespeople in the United States

345
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,560
alone and every single one could use our

346
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,839
software. No, we niche down. We say what

347
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,880
is my partner? What is your direct need?

348
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,880
He tells me and I said okay, what do we

349
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,040
need to build in order to make this

350
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:46,320
successful for you? Now, who else has

351
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,639
the specific problems that you have that

352
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,040
would be willing to pay for this? that

353
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,000
is kind of similar to what you're doing.

354
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,560
So, we picked two other verticals that

355
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,839
are so similar that the app doesn't need

356
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,480
to change. It can be one app. It doesn't

357
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,839
change. We don't have like complex

358
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,920
features to try to reach every

359
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,480
salesperson. We're focusing on people

360
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,320
that do high ticket sales. So, we niche

361
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,519
down to people that do high ticket

362
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,160
sales. Period. End of story. Right? Find

363
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,279
out what they are doing now to solve

364
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,000
their problem. So go do some research on

365
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,519
those people. Ask them questions like,

366
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,199
"Hey, what do you use now to solve XYZ

367
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,040
problem?" So now you kind of know what

368
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,279
your problem is. You kind of know who

369
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,760
your customer is. Interview a few other

370
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,839
people in that market and ask them the

371
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:39,120
question, what are you doing to solve

372
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:42,000
this problem? Now then do some research

373
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,240
on those competitors and ask them, hey,

374
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,959
are you using X software? X software. X

375
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:50,639
software. No, I'm not. Okay. Why don't

376
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:53,839
you use XYZ software for this problem?

377
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,639
Is it cost? Is it ease of use? Is it

378
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:59,440
lack of features? Or did you just not

379
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,040
know about that other software? If you

380
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,440
didn't know about it, then the problem

381
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,800
might not be big enough to search for a

382
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,560
solution in order to solve that problem.

383
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,639
So therefore, the problem might not

384
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,240
actually be big enough than what it is

385
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,720
that you're making it out to be in your

386
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:20,399
mind. So this is such an essential slide

387
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,720
in this entire process and by far one of

388
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,920
the most overlooked slides. So maybe you

389
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,079
thought about the problem, you thought

390
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,000
about the solution and and then you go

391
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,759
right to development. You go right to

392
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,199
hey, I need to hire somebody. We need to

393
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,040
start working and blah blah blah blah

394
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,600
blah blah blah. Skipping all these

395
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,399
essential steps along the way. But this

396
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,160
one slide could have saved you months

397
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,959
allowed you to pivot to a different

398
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,560
idea. And in those 3 months that you're

399
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,639
struggling to build something that no

400
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,160
one wants, you could otherwise be

401
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,160
working on something that people do

402
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,240
want, that you're solving a problem,

403
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,040
gets you closer to money faster, closer

404
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,959
to revenue faster, and really closes the

405
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:01,279
gap on what it takes to be successful in

406
00:16:57,959 --> 00:17:05,120
software, right? So, if these answers

407
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:07,520
tell you what you need to know and if

408
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,520
it's successful, you should build the

409
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:13,520
solution. So answer those questions.

410
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,120
Period. End of story. If you're not

411
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,959
interviewing people, if you're not

412
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,640
willing to interview people, you

413
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,679
shouldn't get in the software business

414
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,400
because you need to understand if the

415
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,079
problem is actually worth solving. Do

416
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,760
that first. Tam

417
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:32,240
Sam, what does it mean? Why is it

418
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,000
important? Why should you care? Total

419
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:39,120
addressable market. That's TAM. So, like

420
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,320
I said, 5 million salespeople in the

421
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,200
United States. I don't know how many

422
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,320
sales people there are. 20 million

423
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,039
salespeople coming out of the womb

424
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,039
selling something like I don't know, but

425
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,559
that's total addressable market. So,

426
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,400
take your ICP and put it into chat GPT

427
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,360
and ask what the total addressable

428
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,240
market for a problem that you're solving

429
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,400
to an ICP. What is a total addressable

430
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,480
market? Next one is serviceable

431
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,679
addressable market like if they're

432
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,480
already paying for something total is

433
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:12,640
everybody and then serviceable is

434
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,039
they're paying for your competitors and

435
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,640
then your share of the market is the

436
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:21,200
smallest number. So if we say 100% is

437
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:23,760
total, serviceable is maybe 30%, 40%

438
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,520
that are paying for something else and

439
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,039
share of the market maybe you can

440
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:32,160
capture a fraction of a percent of that

441
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:36,480
marketplace and that would be your share

442
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,640
of market. Make sense? Again, chat GP03

443
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,720
breaks all this down for you and then

444
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,720
from there you can plug in what people

445
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,559
would be willing to pay for it. You can

446
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,880
start building out some financial models

447
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,400
of what you could potentially do in your

448
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,240
share of the market share. You can tell

449
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,400
chatb03 to be aggressive. You can tell

450
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,640
it to be conservative. You can tell it

451
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,640
to give you low-end numbers. You can

452
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,440
tell it whatever you want to create your

453
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,760
projections. But you could basically

454
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,320
build projections based upon TAM, SAM,

455
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,799
and SAM.

456
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,880
Cool. All right. So what somebody is

457
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,080
willing to pay for an app interview

458
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:17,600
people and say if I solve this problem

459
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,440
would you be willing to pay X is that

460
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,480
worth it to you and you need to

461
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,600
understand that what is the value that

462
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,200
you're bringing with the solution again

463
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,559
we're building we have we have software

464
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,520
for hospitals and um some of our tickets

465
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,240
are quite high in the millions but the

466
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,799
problem that we're solving is well

467
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,679
beyond ond what it is that we are

468
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,799
offering. In some cases, uh we actually

469
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,919
built a um uh return on investment

470
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,000
calculator on our website. And in some

471
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:54,240
cases, some of the people that we've

472
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,799
gotten started with have 600% ROI even

473
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,799
at spending millions of dollars using

474
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,160
our software. So, take that in

475
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:04,559
consideration. See if people are willing

476
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:07,120
to pay for the solution. Build a landing

477
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,039
page. get people willing to pay for it.

478
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,120
Validate your idea before you start

479
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,960
building your idea. So, not only do we

480
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,520
interview people, but I'll actually put

481
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,120
up a landing page and validate to see if

482
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,919
people would actually pay for it. Either

483
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,880
getting them to opt in for a wait list

484
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,039
or actually pay for something and call

485
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,960
it a pre-sale product or just refund

486
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,360
them and say, "Hey, it's not ready yet.

487
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,440
I'll let you know when it is." All this

488
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,240
is covered in great detail in our

489
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,880
ideation course at macanzac.com, by the

490
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,840
way. So I go through this. Every single

491
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,799
one of these slides is an entire video

492
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,400
with additional insights and steps and

493
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,600
walkthroughs and so forth. This would be

494
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,480
a 8 hour video if I just record this all

495
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,320
together. So everything's over in

496
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:53,919
macans.com. You can go check it out.

497
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,000
Building your prototype in days, not

498
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,120
months. Once you build out your entire

499
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,640
plan, put this into

500
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,480
chatg03. You are an expert developer.

501
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,440
Build me a plan on how to create a

502
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:09,520
prototype that solves fill-in- thelank

503
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,679
for ICP fill-in- thelank using Replet. I

504
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,840
love Replet. I've been very successful

505
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,960
with it. I've used like eight different

506
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,440
AI building apps and I think Replet is

507
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,440
putting out the best results personally.

508
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,039
So, that's the one I'm using, but I put

509
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,880
it in quotations. If you use something

510
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,600
else, you use something else. Whatever.

511
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,120
Use the same format. If you are an

512
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,039
expert developer, build me a plan of how

513
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:37,360
to create a prototype that solves

514
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:40,159
problem for ICP using platform in days,

515
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,320
not months. That's key because the first

516
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,280
thing it's going to build out for you is

517
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,000
some 6 to 12 month plan, but then you

518
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,799
say in days, not months. Then it starts

519
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,400
really bringing down to get a prototype

520
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:56,559
online and it starts refining that plan.

521
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,640
From there, you can further refine the

522
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,559
plan by responding back and saying,

523
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,159
"Hey, that's not quite the feature that

524
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,640
I had in mind. That's not quite the

525
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,280
thing that I had in mind. Add this, take

526
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,360
that away, do this, do that." Have a

527
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,840
conversation with ChatGpt back and forth

528
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:15,120
to really refine that plan. Once you

529
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,840
have your plan together, use chat GP03

530
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,600
and put this in. Using the plan above,

531
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,480
or you can copy and paste the plan in,

532
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,720
whatever. using a plan above, build me a

533
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,679
replet or whichever platform you're

534
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,840
using, a replet prompt to start the

535
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,280
development of this app to build the

536
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,320
prototype in days, not months. Again, I

537
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,360
tell it really fast. I'm not trying to

538
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,400
be over complicated with this. it could

539
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,200
find opportunities to not necessarily

540
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,679
shortcut but you know kind of omit some

541
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,880
features like hey maybe we shouldn't do

542
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,799
this piece yet just for the prototype or

543
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,600
hey maybe we should use a third party

544
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:58,880
connection for this instead of doing it

545
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:02,000
this way it's a great way to make chat

546
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,400
GPT reason and come up with faster

547
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,360
prototype delivery so that's a really

548
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,760
key essential here okay prompting and

549
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,760
replet After you add the promplet into

550
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,520
Replet, it will start building the

551
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,400
prototype and this is free to get

552
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,320
started. I think I pay like 50 75 bucks

553
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,720
a month now, whatever I'm paying them.

554
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,960
Um, but I've built so many different

555
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,720
things and we're hosting and or

556
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,880
whatever, doing so many things through

557
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,280
the platform. But getting started, it's

558
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,280
free. There could be some errors on

559
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,919
screen as it starts kicking it out. When

560
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,640
they come up, just copy the error, feed

561
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,559
it right back into Replet. After an hour

562
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,840
or so, you should have an app that you

563
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,080
can click through and you can start

564
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:44,640
messing with and you can drill down. But

565
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,120
if errors are persistent, go back to

566
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:51,280
chat GPTO3, take the error, put it in

567
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:53,919
there, and ask chat GPTO3 for how to fix

568
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,080
that bug in Replet, and it'll give you a

569
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,400
better prompt to respond back to Replet.

570
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,679
So, really smart thing. Um, I'll take

571
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,440
you through one of my Replet builds.

572
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,159
Let's do it. Okay, so this is one of my

573
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,760
Replet builds, and I pasted in to get

574
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,760
started. exactly what came from chatb3.

575
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,559
It said exactly what it is that I'm

576
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,799
building. It gives this full kick out

577
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,679
and I just copied and pasted it directly

578
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:20,000
in. No editing at all. It just totally

579
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,120
just kicked it out. So, it started

580
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,559
thinking and uh let's look at the

581
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:29,120
timestamps. So, uh 10:06 a.m. on April

582
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,440
21st, I started working on it. So, it's

583
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,799
kicking it out and it builds this thing

584
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:38,640
and it looks terrible, but it's a

585
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:41,440
website, right? And that took how long?

586
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,400
That took

587
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,240
uh what was it? 06. So, it took 20

588
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,480
minutes, less than 20 minutes, like 15

589
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,559
minutes, whatever it is. Um, and then I

590
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,039
was like, "Hey, here's my logo, here's

591
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,960
my contact information, here's, you

592
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,400
know, my social media information. Go

593
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,640
ahead and update that." So, I just gave

594
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,440
it back and it updates some things.

595
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,960
uh going through when the logo is on a

596
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,520
dark background. Use this version. Okay.

597
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,919
Updated. Um also it started looking a

598
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,960
little bit better because I prompted it

599
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,240
to uh what was that prompt? Uh design

600
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,159
the landing page to look more like a

601
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,400
billion-dollar software company. So it

602
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,159
took that literally and it said

603
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,919
developing billion-dollar technology.

604
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,440
That's really not what I wanted to say,

605
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:27,279
but whatever. Let's just keep going. Uh

606
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,520
the header starts scrolling down. it

607
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,520
needs to use dark etc. you know just

608
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,760
kind of giving it some natural you know

609
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,240
verbiage. Uh remove the section where

610
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,080
product projects launched uh partner

611
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,400
with industry leaders go ahead and add

612
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,799
those. So yeah point is just flowing

613
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,480
through this thing just you know talking

614
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,880
to it asking questions talking. It's

615
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,200
11-1ven. It's been 1 hour. I mean I got

616
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,880
something pretty decent. I mean, I could

617
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,720
literally go live with something like

618
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,640
this, but I I want to refine it a little

619
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,919
bit more. I keep going. Now, it looks

620
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,760
good. Let's work on the dashboard, etc.

621
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,400
So, it starts kicking out some more

622
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,559
things for

623
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:11,960
me. And we just go and go and, you know,

624
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:14,000
it creates a uh login

625
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,320
authentication, and it just keeps going

626
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,240
down. We just keep uh so error on

627
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,880
dashboard, page, runtime, whatever, it

628
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,679
starts fixing it. So yeah, just

629
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:27,480
scrolling down, you know, just going

630
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:30,400
through it. Um 108. So it started at

631
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:33,440
10:06, it's 108. I probably took a break

632
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,679
for lunch. Um I don't know what I was

633
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,880
doing. Like probably took a couple phone

634
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,960
calls, let it kind of run, do something

635
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,200
else, multitask,

636
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,559
etc. Uh, so now I'm drilling down a

637
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,279
little bit further, like this needs to

638
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:49,679
do this, this needs to do that, and I'm

639
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,840
just feeding in the URLs to tell it what

640
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:55,440
it needs to do. Uh, it's starting to

641
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:58,159
create, uh, some pages here. Um, so

642
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,799
that's inside a membership area. And

643
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,400
really what this app does, it allows

644
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:06,720
people to go to the app and kind of

645
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,240
validate your idea, kind of talk about

646
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,000
your idea, talk about what you're trying

647
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,520
to solve, and then you can literally

648
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,840
connect with my developers. They'll help

649
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,880
you answer questions, move along the

650
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,799
process, etc. If you want to hire us to

651
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,720
do something that's kind of complicated,

652
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,200
you can hire us right inside the app.

653
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,000
We'll work for hourly rate in order to

654
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,159
deliver the results, etc. So I wanted to

655
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,400
have an app an easy way that I can

656
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:33,440
manage all my projects all from one

657
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:36,000
place. So the problem I was solving all

658
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,200
my communication is so disjointed for my

659
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,080
business. I need to have a single place

660
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,760
where I can do all of my work and have

661
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,559
my developers communicate and me

662
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,039
communicate and we can work through and

663
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,880
develop projects very easily. a really

664
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:54,320
easy onboarding process for new

665
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,640
business. And I needed something complex

666
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,039
but simple. And that was essentially

667
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,679
what it is that uh Replet built for me

668
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:04,080
was an app that is really simple to

669
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,760
manage projects and um you know get

670
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,760
things moving along and have a nice

671
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,679
onboarding wizard and all those other

672
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:14,320
things. Um so yeah, fixing a login page,

673
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:18,799
fixing more things. Uh let's see where

674
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:20,880
we're at. Uh 728. So, at this point, go

675
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:24,159
and pick my kids up, you know, come

676
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,240
home, make dinner, get back on, prompt

677
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,480
it a couple more times. There's probably

678
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:33,159
a bedtime in here. Um, probably put them

679
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,240
to bed, and then working on a little bit

680
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:37,279
more. Uh, started working on confetti. I

681
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,320
don't know why I was working on

682
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:46,559
confetti, but 9:32. So, I started at

683
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:49,360
10:06 and I deployed the app at 9:32. So

684
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,200
that's what less than 12 hours I had an

685
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,520
app ready to go live that solved a huge

686
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:58,880
problem for me and it looks great like

687
00:28:54,520 --> 00:29:03,919
up it's awesome like what could have

688
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:06,240
been developed for this in 12 hours. I I

689
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:10,039
you know put the video placeholder there

690
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:13,760
but literally 12 hours built something

691
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:17,440
that was a serious problem for me. I was

692
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:21,120
able to build this in hours, not weeks,

693
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,000
not months, hours. It It's absolutely

694
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,240
insane. So, I love this app. I love

695
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,960
building web apps with this app. It

696
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,440
doesn't really make native iOS apps, but

697
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,000
you could still build your prototype on

698
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,799
a web base and then give it over to a

699
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:41,600
developer to then turn it into a React

700
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:44,000
iOS app if you want uh an app to be

701
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,799
delivered on phones. But point is

702
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,320
prototype here easy. Took me less than

703
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:52,480
12 hours. Prototype done. Period. People

704
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,360
could be signing up less than 12 hours

705
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,679
later. So let's hop back to the slides.

706
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,520
Okay, so you have your prototype built.

707
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,919
Again, took less than 12 hours to build

708
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,600
that app. If everything is working, you

709
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,760
could publish it right through Replet.

710
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,600
If you need assistance with deploying,

711
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,679
you can contact me, message me,

712
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,000
whatever. Let's talk about it. Or go

713
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,919
hire somebody on Upwork. Get the bugs

714
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,240
all sorted out, get your security all

715
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,720
buttoned up, and then get a few beta

716
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,039
testers on board, test the prototype,

717
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,799
fix the bugs as they start sharing those

718
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:25,440
bugs with you. Then you can start

719
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,120
improving the UI, which is called user

720
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,200
interface. That's basically the design

721
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,960
and so forth, and the user experience

722
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,840
like, hey, when I click on this, it

723
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,399
should go to a wizard and not go to, you

724
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,039
know, some long form. It should be a

725
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,760
step-by-step wizard. Whatever, whatever

726
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,200
bugs or ideas they bring you. You could

727
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,039
kind of take that and just kind of plan

728
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,520
out how to fix that. Now, you have a

729
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:49,200
working prototype. It's live. You could

730
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,559
literally have something that people are

731
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,200
using and they're giving you feedback

732
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:56,000
on. Congratulations. I mean, you're

733
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,159
pre-revenue, but you're in business and

734
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,559
it could be a couple hours. Sales

735
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,720
commitments. This is the next big step.

736
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:05,360
Again, this is something that I don't

737
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,440
see people too often doing, but it's so

738
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,240
essential. So, at this point, your app

739
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,520
might not have billing integration, like

740
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,520
the one I showed you did no billing

741
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:18,039
integration. Okay, that's fine. get

742
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:20,720
written commitments, non-binding

743
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:23,840
agreements from companies, people that

744
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,919
would be willing to use that technology

745
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,720
either in their business if you're

746
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,919
deploying a white label solution or if

747
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,640
it's a you know billing type thing that

748
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,440
um you know they would pay for access to

749
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,000
the software then get commitments. If I

750
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,760
built this out in the next 6 months

751
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,600
would you be willing to pay for it? Yes

752
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,760
or no? be transparent with those

753
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,320
timelines and go to live in production

754
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,559
and try to get at least 100,000 to

755
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,559
200,000 in annual recurring revenue

756
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:56,880
commitments. It's a pretty big job to do

757
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,480
that, but like I said, if you're solving

758
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,240
big enough problems with your

759
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,320
technology, you should be able to get

760
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,159
that from just a couple clients for them

761
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,000
to say, "Yeah, if you could solve this,

762
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,600
I would go ahead and pay for it because

763
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,240
my problem is worth far more than 50,000

764
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,600
or $100,000 a year. my problem is worth

765
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,320
$500,000 a year and time and money and

766
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,640
all all those things and then all your

767
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,200
other features become those ancillary

768
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,360
benefits that you're adding in. Take

769
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,320
those commitments and then let's go

770
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,880
raise some capital. That's it. So, how

771
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,799
fast can this

772
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:36,159
happen? How fast can it how fast can you

773
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,960
get through this? So, example, a friend

774
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,399
of mine uh sales guy says, "Hey, come

775
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,559
have coffee with me." It was a Friday

776
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,000
morning. I had coffee with him and he

777
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,919
pitched me his idea and I was like,

778
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,120
"Wow, that's insane." I came home, did

779
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:52,080
the research on Chat GPT and I was like,

780
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,919
"Uh, I'm building this. This is this is

781
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,760
awesome. I'm building it." So,

782
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,760
literally, I had the prototype by that

783
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,240
night, uh, coffee in the morning,

784
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:03,600
prototype at night. I had it on, uh,

785
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,279
sales professionals phones that weekend.

786
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,440
I send it over to him. He starts using

787
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,120
it. All these sales pros start using it.

788
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,279
And then they start saying, "Hey, if

789
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,039
this could connect to my CRM and then

790
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,880
call things up from my CRM, that would

791
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,399
be amazing. Could you do that?" Yeah,

792
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,200
cool. Yeah, I can do that. It's a great

793
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,440
idea. Right. So, we start working

794
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,679
through the features and working through

795
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,360
the things of which they start asking

796
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,039
for and then we start getting some

797
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:32,240
commitments and we're raising capital on

798
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:35,919
a $10 million valuation. That's it.

799
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,919
Raising capital. Ask chat GPT03 what a

800
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,000
fair market valuation would be for your

801
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,519
product. Again, total addressable

802
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,399
market, what people are willing to pay

803
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,640
for it. Feed it in that information if

804
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:49,120
it doesn't already have it and let it

805
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,360
base your valuation based upon also

806
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,399
those commitment letters that you have.

807
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,559
Again, before taking any next steps in

808
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,159
raising capital or anything like that,

809
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,519
consult your attorney before taking

810
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,799
these next steps. just to give you an

811
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:06,080
understanding of what the next steps

812
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,440
are. Not to say that you should circumn

813
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,960
your attorney. You should always talk to

814
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,560
your attorney about raising capital.

815
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,760
There's so many, you know, different

816
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,760
nuances of raising capital that need to

817
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,919
be handled by an attorney and I am not

818
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,879
an attorney. So therefore, I cannot give

819
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:23,200
you legal advice. However, the best

820
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:26,800
legal advice I can give you is consult

821
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,520
an attorney who is authorized and

822
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:34,280
accredited and has all those things to

823
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:37,079
give you legal advice. Cool. Do that.

824
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:40,079
But for knowledge

825
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:42,639
purposes, it would be a safe round. That

826
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,720
is a great way to proceed forward. So,

827
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,760
you can ask your attorney what a safe

828
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,599
note is. It is a simple agreement for

829
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,599
future equity. That's what SAFE stands

830
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,679
for. Do some research yourself. Ask Chat

831
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:58,160
GPT, whatever. Ask your attorney if you

832
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,400
should offer discounts on future rounds.

833
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,680
Talk about it. Talk to Chhat GPT. Talk

834
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,800
to your attorney. Figure it out. So, I

835
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,359
like using Chat GPT to research and you

836
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,560
can research what a safe note is to see

837
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:15,280
if it would be a good solution for you

838
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,839
to raise money on a safe note. However,

839
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,480
I can tell you that a lot of investors

840
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:23,760
do like safe notes and you can look into

841
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,480
that. Again, consult an attorney. I

842
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,000
don't know how much many times I need to

843
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,280
say that. You need to talk to an

844
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,560
attorney when you're raising money.

845
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,320
Period. So, use of funds. take the

846
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,200
capital that you raise, build the

847
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,920
prototype, say three months to market,

848
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,520
um $50,000, a little less than 50,000,

849
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,839
maybe a little bit more than 50,000 if

850
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,680
it's got real complex features or

851
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:49,200
security or things like that that need

852
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,760
to be developed or you know multi- uh

853
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,400
application like you know iOS app,

854
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,920
Android app, web app, desktop app. If

855
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,640
you have to have all those things, you

856
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,640
can basically add 10 to $15,000 per

857
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,560
integration that you need to add. So you

858
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,480
can kind of plan those features and plan

859
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,640
what needs to be built based upon that

860
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:09,839
model. Again, you can take that, put it

861
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,400
into chat GP03 and say, "Hey, if I

862
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,000
raise, you know, $50,000, what would be

863
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,240
the best use of money to get this

864
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,640
product closer to market?" Right? So we

865
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,320
use that a lot. Use the rest of the

866
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,520
capital that you have left over. So say

867
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,200
you raise $250,000, 50,000 of that goes

868
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,400
towards building out the product. The

869
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,839
other 200 should go towards paid ads or

870
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,839
other marketing influencer content

871
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:36,480
things like that. You should be creating

872
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:40,079
marketing materials. Again, I cover all

873
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,880
this in great detail in our course that

874
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,200
is inside the AI course. The prototype

875
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,680
is in the prototype course, but this is

876
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,400
in the AI marketing course. I go through

877
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,640
this in great detail at macansacc.com.

878
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,040
You can hop on there. drive clicks to

879
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,560
high converting pages for demos or

880
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:01,520
orders. So if the order is say less than

881
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,359
50 bucks per month, you can just drive

882
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,920
them right to an order page. They can

883
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,160
sign up and um you know pay for it right

884
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,400
there. If it's an expensive software,

885
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,359
you might want to do demos uh and do

886
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:16,000
that. Start scaling your ads. Move over

887
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:18,880
to a priced valuation round. Again,

888
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,280
consult your attorney about fundraising

889
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,000
and all of that. But once you do have

890
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,480
paying customers and it starts scaling,

891
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,480
it's time to do another capital raise on

892
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,800
a valued round. So say you raise

893
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:35,359
$250,000 on a $10 million valuation.

894
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,680
Then you can move into depending on the

895
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,599
valuation of the company, use a fair

896
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,680
valuation based upon your forecast and

897
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,079
all your models. Let's say it's a $50

898
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,920
million valuation at a priced round.

899
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,440
Then you can raise some additional money

900
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,760
from VCs or private equity or you know

901
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,240
people that uh are in the industry,

902
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,320
experts in the industry or you know

903
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,480
people that you know people network

904
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,560
through people, talk to people, talk to

905
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:04,880
me, we can talk about things but point

906
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:07,680
is you move very very quickly with this

907
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,320
plan and you can move quickly but again

908
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:14,400
it all goes back to is the problem

909
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:17,599
you're solving worth solving? Is the

910
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,200
target avatar the right target avatar?

911
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,280
Are you putting these pieces together?

912
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,599
Do you have a good total addressable

913
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,599
market and a serviceable addressable

914
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:30,000
market and your share of market? Like

915
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:33,520
are those numbers right? Like all of

916
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,200
these pieces come into play and it might

917
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,760
make sense to have a mentor or somebody

918
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,760
like me to help you. But point is all

919
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,160
these pieces do come into play to make

920
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,440
sure that you are on track to building

921
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,520
something correctly. You can use chat

922
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:50,000
GP03 for some of this reasoning but

923
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,960
perhaps a mentor uh definitely an

924
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,119
attorney but would help you move a

925
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,440
little bit quicker. So yeah, once you

926
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:59,520
get the price round, hire scale your

927
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,800
venture and then prepare for an exit in

928
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:05,440
3 to 5 years. Boom. Done. That's it.

929
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,280
Rinse and repeat. Do it again. Do it

930
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,839
again and again and again and again. Do

931
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,599
it so many times. It's so much fun.

932
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,599
After I had my first exit, I was like,

933
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:17,720
"Wow, I should just have 10 exits a

934
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:21,280
year, right?" But I need 10 great

935
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:24,400
businesses. I mean, I have five right

936
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:26,720
now, five ventures that uh we're ramping

937
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,119
up and uh taking the exit in the next

938
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,359
three to five years. But yeah, it's I

939
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,400
mean really once you get it down, I mean

940
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:37,599
this is how wealth is built is when you

941
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,960
do something well one time, go and do it

942
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:42,480
again and again and again and again. The

943
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:45,280
first one's going to be the hardest,

944
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,240
they get easier the further you go. So

945
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,359
I'm, you know, couple exits in. It's

946
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,480
getting easier for me. And now with AI,

947
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:56,240
it's creating prototypes like having

948
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,400
breakfast or having coffee in the

949
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,760
morning, having an app by the time

950
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,680
dinner rolls around. It's insane. So,

951
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,720
there is so much here that I did not

952
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,839
have time for. Sign up at

955
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,680
building, the marketing, and then also

956

957
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:21,920
by step kind of like I did on the uh one

958
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,079
page that we did. But we do step by step

959
